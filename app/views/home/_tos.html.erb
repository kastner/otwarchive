<p><em>While the Archive is in beta, it's important for users to be aware of what that means:

<p>We are making every effort to make the archive stable and useful. However, part of that effort is testing the archive, and your contributions are part of the test. Therefore, be advised: the archive or parts of the archive may break! Content may be lost! Features may not work! Administrators will just be getting the hang of administration! Please report bugs, and don't use the beta version of the archive as your only place to store your stories.

<p>This is a work in progress. We appreciate your forbearance and your willingness to be a part of the Archive at this early stage. Thank you!</em>

<p><em>The Archive of Our Own is a place for fanworks, including fan fiction based on books, TV, movies, comics, other media, and real-person fiction (RPF).</em></p>

<p><strong>What We Believe</strong></p>


<p>1.    Our goal is maximum inclusiveness (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'max_inclusiveness') -%>) of content. Our software is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/otwarchive/">open-source and available</a> for others to use if they wish to implement the code elsewhere.</p>


<p>2.    We are committed to defending fanworks against legal challenges.  Our position on transformative fanworks is detailed in the <a href="http://transformativeworks.org/faq/#legal"><acronym>OTW FAQ</acronym></a>.  We have legal resources and alliances on which we will draw.  However, that is not a guarantee that the organization can or will fight each battle. The Board will take into account a variety of factors, both legal and otherwise, in responding to a legal challenge. Further information is available <a href="http://www.transformativeworks.org/projects/legal.html">on the <acronym>OTW</acronym> site</a>.</p>


<p>3.    We strive to make the Terms of Service (<acronym title="Terms of Service">ToS</acronym>) readable.  We have tried to provide explanations for the more unusual legal terms.  If you have terminology questions not covered here, Law.com's glossary may help, though we cannot vouch for the accuracy of outside sources, including those referenced in the <acronym>ToS</acronym>.</p>


<p>There are five parts to the Terms of Service (<acronym>ToS</acronym>):</p>

<p><a href="#general">I. General Principles</a>
<br /><a href="#age">II. Age Policy</a>
<br /><a href="#privacy">III. Privacy Policy</a>
<br /><a href="#content">IV. Content and Abuse Policies</a> 
<br /><a href="#specialized">V. Assorted Specialized Policies</a> (Forthcoming.)</p>


<p><a name="general">I. <strong>General Principles</strong></a></p>


<p>A.    The legalese: including where a lawsuit would be filed, when, and under what law</p>


<p>The <acronym>ToS</acronym> constitute the entire agreement between you and the Organization for Transformative Works (<acronym title="Organization for Transformative Works">OTW</acronym>) and govern your use of the Service (the Archive of Our Own).</p>


<p>The <acronym>ToS</acronym> and the relationship between you and the <acronym>OTW</acronym> shall be governed by the laws of the United States state of New York (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'NY_law') -%>), without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>


<p>You and the <acronym>OTW</acronym> agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within New York County (Manhattan), New York.</p>


<p>The <acronym>OTW</acronym>'s failure to enforce any part of the <acronym>ToS</acronym> will not waive the <acronym>OTW</acronym>'s ability to enforce it, and any waiver with regard to a specific instance shall not constitute a waiver of any other breaches of the <acronym>ToS</acronym>, even with regard to the same user.</p>


<p>If any provision of the <acronym>ToS</acronym> is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you agree that the court should give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the <acronym>ToS</acronym> remain in full force and effect.</p>


<p>You agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Archive or the <acronym>ToS</acronym> must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>


<p>B.    You agree to the Terms of Service</p>


<p>1. By submitting a story, comment, image, item of information, tag, or any other form of content ("Content") to the Archive, you state that you agree to comply with the <acronym>ToS</acronym>.</p>


<p>2. We may update the <acronym>ToS</acronym> as necessary.  If the <acronym>ToS</acronym> change in the future, this is how the process will work: Changes in the <acronym>ToS</acronym> may be proposed at any time by or to the <acronym>OTW</acronym> Board. Proposed changes will be prominently disclosed on the <a href="http://transformativeworks.org">OTW website</a>, and we will offer at least a two-week comment period for proposed changes. At the end of the comment period, proposed changes will be voted on by the Board.  If the Board votes in favor, the changes will become effective at that time. You can learn about changes in the <acronym>ToS</acronym> by visiting the <a href="http://transformativeworks.org">OTW website</a> or subscribing to our <a href="transformativeworks.org/node/type/news/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>


<p>C.    Potential problems with the Service</p>


<p>1. The <acronym>OTW</acronym> provides services, including the Archive of Our Own, on an "as is" and "as available" basis.  The <acronym>OTW</acronym> does not warrant (that is, does not make a legally binding promise) that our services will meet your requirements; that our services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; or that the results you get from using the services will be accurate, reliable, or satisfactory to you.  We will endeavor to provide the best possible service to users of the site, but many things (e.g. possible outages, hackings, etc.) are not within our control and we cannot provide for all eventualities.</p>


<p>Any material you download, view, or otherwise access through <acronym>OTW</acronym> services or sites is at your own risk.  You will be solely responsible for any damage or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.</p>


<p>2. The <acronym>OTW</acronym> expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the (<%= link_to 'implied warranties of merchantability', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'merchantability') -%>), fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.  The <acronym>ToS</acronym> govern your use of the <acronym>OTW</acronym>'s services, and therefore no communication from anyone associated with the <acronym>OTW</acronym> will create any warranty that isn't expressly stated in the <acronym>ToS</acronym>.</p>


<p>3. You expressly agree that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> shall not be liable to you for any damages of any kind (even if the <acronym>OTW</acronym> has been advised of the possibility of such damages) resulting from the services, including but not limited to your use of or inability to use the services; unauthorized access to or changes in Content or information you submit; and the acts and statements of third parties who use the services.</p>


<p>4. You agree that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of or limitation on your access to <acronym>OTW</acronym> services.  The <acronym>OTW</acronym> may change, end, or put services or parts of services on hiatus at any time.</p>


<p>5. You agree that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> shall not be liable to you for any claim arising out of Content you make available, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your use of the <acronym>ToS</acronym>, or your violation of any rights of another.</p>


<p>In other words, the <acronym>OTW</acronym> is not liable to you for allowing you to post Content, download Content, or do other things with <acronym>OTW</acronym> services.  The <acronym>OTW</acronym> does not assume whatever legal risks you face by posting, viewing, or doing other things with Content.</p>


<p>D.    What you can't do:</p>


<p>You agree to not use the <acronym>OTW</acronym> services (including the e-mail addresses and URLs of <acronym>OTW</acronym> sites):</p>


<p>1. to make available any Content that violates the <a href="#content">Content Policy</a>;</p>


<p>2. to impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an <acronym>OTW</acronym> representative, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity (fiction marked as such, including real-person fiction in first-person format, is not subject to this policy);</p>


<p>3. to forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any Content transmitted to or through the <acronym>OTW</acronym> services (headers and identifiers are defined as information actually used or intended to be used to route or authenticate Content, and do not include Content that simulates identifiers as part of a story, such as a fictional e-mail exchange);</p>


<p>4. to make available any Content that a court has ruled constitutes patent, trademark, trade secret or copyright infringement (please be aware of the <acronym>OTW</acronym>'s <a href="http://transformativeworks.org/faq/#legal">position on fanwork legality</a>);</p>


<p>5. to make available <a href="#spam">any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising</a> (defined as solicitations for direct or indirect commercial advantage), junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of solicitation;</p>


<p>6. to make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer or hardware or telecommunications equipment;</p>


<p>7. to interfere with or disrupt <acronym>OTW</acronym> sites or servers or networks connected to <acronym>OTW</acronym> sites;</p>


<p>8. to create an account if you are a resident or national of any country to which the U.S. has prohibited transactions by mandating a trade embargo, as detailed further by <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/">the State Department</a>; or</p>


<p>9. to use <acronym>OTW</acronym> services to break any law that applies to you, including any rules or regulations having the force of law.  Just by way of example, do not use the services to disseminate restricted technologies or violate laws governing the export of technical data.  This provision is not intended to deal with matters subject to the <a href="#content">Content Policy</a>, but the Content Policy cannot cover every law in every country.  As a general matter, the Archive follows US law.  Content that is alleged to violate the law of a relevant jurisdiction will be dealt with according to the procedures established in the <a href="#content">Abuse Policy</a>.</p>


<p>E.     Content you see through use of the Service:</p>


<p>1. The <acronym>OTW</acronym> or users of its services may provide links to other sites.  The <acronym>OTW</acronym> has no control over such sites, and you agree that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> is not responsible for and does not endorse their content or availability. (Please do report dead links to the OTW webmasters or to Archive administrators.)</p>


<p><a name="exposure">2.</a> You understand that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> does not prescreen Content or review it for purposes of compliance with the <acronym>ToS</acronym>.  This includes but is not limited to story information, story content, text, graphics, comments, or any other material.  Content is the sole responsibility of the people who submitted it.  You understand that using the Archive may expose you to material that is offensive, erroneous, sexually explicit, indecent, blasphemous, objectionable, or badly spelled.</p>


<p>3. You recognize that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> does not endorse Content on the Archive in any way, except when material appears as an official statement of the <acronym>OTW</acronym>.  No committee members, officers, or directors of the <acronym>OTW</acronym> are acting in an official capacity when they post fanwork, commentary, or other Content of the type generally provided by site users. Official announcements can be found on the <a href="http://transformativeworks.org/">OTW Website</a>.

<p>4. The <acronym>OTW</acronym> is not liable to you for any Content to which you are exposed on or because of the Archive.</p>


<p>F.    Valid e-mail address:</p>


<p>1. As part of your registration, you agree to provide an accurate and current e-mail address and to update the address as necessary.  If your e-mail address is inaccurate or not current, the Archive may suspend your account <%= link_to 'suspend your account', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'out_of_date') -%>.  Unless there are other circumstances, such as voluntary deletion by a user, Content provided by suspended accounts before the suspension will not be removed.</p>


<p>2. By registering or otherwise using an e-mail address in connection with the Archive, you assert that the e-mail address is not listed on any child protection registry.  (There are child protection registries in Michigan and Utah, and our policy applies to any others that exist or may be adopted, whether local, state, or national, including any outside the U.S.)</p>


<p>G.    What we do with your content:</p>


<p>The <acronym>OTW</acronym> does not claim any ownership or copyright in your Content. Repeat: we do not own your content. Nothing in this agreement changes that in any way. Running the Archive, however, requires us to make copies, and backup copies, on servers that may be located anywhere around the world.</p>


<p>1. You agree that we can make those copies and show your Content to other people, subject to your privacy settings.  Specifically, by submitting Content, you grant the <acronym>OTW</acronym> a world-wide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to make your Content available.  "Making available" includes distributing, reproducing, performing, displaying, compiling, and modifying or adapting (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'worldwide_nonexclusive') -%>).</p>


<p>Modifying and adapting here refer strictly to how your work is displayed&#8212;not how it is written. We will never change the wording of your story. But because your Content may be transmitted over various networks, we may have to make changes to the formatting or display of your Content in order to adapt to the technical requirements of different networks or devices.  Multimedia content may not display properly on all devices.  In some circumstances, we may make changes to improve accessibility.  For example, we may automatically convert html tags to our standard forms (e.g., changing "bold" html to "strong").  Or we may make special provisions for accessibility, such as allowing you to use nonstandard fonts but also providing an alternate format for those who cannot read such fonts.  We may use an internal search engine whose results display relevant snippets from your Content.</p>


<p>2. Subject to the next paragraph of this policy, this license exists only for as long as you choose to continue to include such Content on the Archive and will terminate within a reasonable time after you remove or the <acronym>OTW</acronym> removes such Content from the Archive.  We will always strive to make your Content unavailable to users as soon as possible should you choose to remove it.  Though removed Content will not be publicly available, for legal and disaster recovery purposes we may retain backup copies for longer periods.</p>


<p>3. You may provide Content to a part of the Archive that you do not completely control.  For example, you may decide to participate in a challenge run by another user. Or you may provide Content to a part of the Archive where your Content can be deleted by other users, for example a comments page.  Where this is the case, by submitting Content to those parts of the site you agree to the rules for removing and retaining such Content on those parts of the site.</p>


<p>4. You acknowledge and agree that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> may preserve Content and may disclose Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process; enforce the <acronym>ToS</acronym>; respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the <acronym>OTW</acronym> services' users and the public.</p>


<p><a name="age">II. <strong>Archive Age Policy</strong></a></p>


<p>This Age Policy covers the Archive's treatment of users under the age of thirteen (13).</p>


<p>In compliance with United States regulations regarding online privacy for children, the <acronym>OTW</acronym> and its sites do not knowingly solicit or collect information from children under the age of thirteen (13).  Children under the age of thirteen (13) are therefore not permitted to have an account or upload Content of any type to an <acronym>OTW</acronym> site.  By submitting Content to an <acronym>OTW</acronym> site, you thereby confirm that you are thirteen (13) years old or older (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'age_faq') -%>).</p>


<p>Asking a parent or legal guardian to upload Content does not constitute submitting Content under this policy.  If you are under the age of thirteen (13), your parent or legal guardian may upload your Content through his or her account.</p>


<p><a name="privacy">III. <strong>Archive Privacy Policy</strong></a></p>


<p>A.    The Archive is a project of the Organization for Transformative Works (<acronym>OTW</acronym>), which is committed to fan privacy.  For more information about how you can support the <acronym>OTW</acronym>, please see the <a href="http://www.transformativeworks.org/"><acronym>OTW</acronym> Website</a>.  This Privacy Policy governs the Archive.</p>


<p>B.    This Privacy Policy covers the Archive's treatment of personally identifying information submitted to us and which we collect when you use our services in the course of ordinary communications. If you follow links off the Archive, you should review those sites' privacy policies, which may be different, and for which the Archive takes no responsibility.</p>


<p>C.    If this policy changes at any point in the future, we will post the policy changes to the <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/en/tos">Archive of Our Own</a>. Such changes will be used only for information provided by those who have visited, used, or accessed the site after the effective date of such policy changes.  If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at the Archive site periodically.</p>


<p>D.    If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, please contact Archive administrators.</p>


<p>E.    What we will do:</p>


<p>1. We may collect personally identifying information when you register for a user account with the Archive, visit any of the Archive sites, or use any of the Archive services.</p>


<p>2. We will use your e-mail address internally, and if you make it public on the site, anyone can access it and use it for any purpose.  We may occasionally send e-mails to you from the Archive.  We reserve the right to send you notice of violations or suspensions of the Terms of Service, as well as to reply to any e-mail message you send to the Archive.</p>


<p>3. We may retain (1) the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail; (2) user-specific information about what pages users access or visit; (3) the IP address of each visitor to our sites; and (4) any information that a person sends to <acronym>OTW</acronym> or Archive e-mail addresses (i.e., any e-mail to an administrator or other official address).</p>


<p>4. We use cookies to store visitors' preferences; customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends; and record activity at our sites in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site.  Cookies must be enabled for the site to function properly with your computer.  The Archive has no access to cookies set by other sites.</p>


<p>5. If for any reason you terminate your user account with us, we will destroy active records containing your identifying information as soon as reasonably possible. "Reasonably" here means no more than seven business days from the termination of the account, but we may have to retain some information for legal records. If we terminate your service, we may retain enough information to prevent you from signing up for the service in the future.</p>


<p>6. If we receive a complaint about a violation of someone's intellectual property rights, we will disclose the information provided by the rightsholder or the rightsholder's representative to the subject of the complaint. If we receive a complaint about other matters, such as plagiarism or harassment, we will follow the <a href="#content">Abuse Policy</a>, which explains what information provided by the complainant may be disclosed to the subject of the complaint.</p>


<p>F.    What we will not do:</p>


<p>1. The Archive will not give out any of your personal information or any of the information we collect, except as provided under this policy. We will not use your personally identifying information to market third party products and services to you. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifying information.</p>


<p>2. We will not disclose your personally identifying information to any third party without your prior consent unless we (1) are legally compelled to do so, (2) have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on the <acronym>OTW</acronym>, or (3) are cooperating with law enforcement authorities.  As to (3), we will cooperate with all investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities of the United States of America when legally required to do so. Cooperation with law enforcement authorities from other countries and cooperation when it is not legally required are at our sole discretion. Our discretion looks favorably on freedom and justice, and unfavorably on oppression and violence.</p>


<p>3. Unless legally prohibited, we will attempt to notify you any time we disclose your personally identifying information.  In some cases, the information we have, such as an IP address, may be insufficient for us to notify you.</p>


<p><a name="content">IV. <strong>Content and Abuse Policies</strong></a></p>


<p>We recognize that there is no such thing as a popular abuse policy.  By their nature, abuse complaints are unpleasant at best.  And policy needs to be applied by people, which always complicates matters.  We have tried to set out clear procedures to minimize and channel the inevitable conflicts.</p>


<p>The Content and Abuse policy covers <a href="#procedures">procedures</a>, <a href="#spam">spam and commercial promotion</a>, <a href="#tech">threatening the technical integrity of the site</a>, <a href="#copyright">copyright</a>, <a href="#plagiarism">plagiarism</a>, <a href="#personal">personal information and fannish identities</a>, <a href="#harassment">harassment</a>, <a href="#illegal">illegal and non-fanwork content</a>, and <a href="#ratings">ratings and warnings</a>.  We have developed a <acronym>FAQ</acronym> page to answer additional questions about Content and Abuse (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'content_faq') -%>).</p>


<p>The Archive does not prescreen for content.  Complaints are investigated only when they are submitted through the appropriate channels and with the appropriate information.</p>


<p><a name="procedures">A.    Procedures</a></p>


<p>1. <em>Submitting a complaint</em></p>


<p>Complaints may be submitted to our abuse team. Except in the case of <a href="#copyright">copyright complaints</a>, a complainant may submit a complaint via <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/en/abuse">the web form</a>, which does not require identifying information. Depending on the nature of the complaint, however, anonymity may hinder our ability to verify the complaint or affect the credibility of the complaint. In order for the abuse team to follow up on any allegation, the exact location (URL) and nature of the alleged violation must be supplied in the original complaint.  Repeated unverified abuse complaints from the same source may be subject to summary rejection.</p>


<p>2. <em>Treatment and investigation of complaints</em></p>


<p>Only people who need to know about a complaint will be informed about it. The details of any individual complaint are confidential and must be used only in resolving that complaint.</p>


<p>The subject of a complaint may also be among those who need to know about it. Only information provided in the complaint will be passed on. The complainant has complete control over what information is submitted to Abuse, and can submit the complaint anonymously. (Legal names and other information sufficient to identify a person in the physical world will never be disclosed as part of a standard abuse complaint. For further clarification, please see <a href="http://transformativeworks.org/privacy">our privacy policy</a>.)</p>


<p>In general, the abuse team will only communicate with the subject of a complaint if there appears to be a violation of the abuse policy, or if the abuse team needs more information to resolve the issue.</p>


<p>The abuse team records the IP address from which each anonymous complaint is submitted, to prevent abuse of the abuse system.</p>


<p>Subject to obligations of confidentiality about specific complaints, the abuse team may release statistics about general trends, such as the number of plagiarism complaints made and the actions taken by the abuse team, in public or to other <acronym>OTW</acronym> committees, to facilitate discussions of policies, procedures, and trends in abuse complaints.</p>


<p>Complaints will be reviewed by two members from the volunteer abuse team.  If they agree on an action, that action will be taken.  If they disagree, a third member will review the complaint, and the team will proceed by majority vote.</p>


<p>When the abuse team determines that content needs to be removed, if contact information is available, the abuse team will notify the original poster (the complaint subject), identify the nature of the problem with the content, and set a deadline for voluntary removal of the content.  If the original poster does not remove the content within the deadline, the Archive will remove the content.  In addition, we may remove content immediately, without waiting for a response, if we are contacted by a legitimate law enforcement agency or if we determine that the content is threatening to an individual or reveals an individual's personal information without consent.  In such cases we will inform the original poster as soon as possible.  The original poster will then have the option to resubmit with the violating content removed.</p>


<p>The abuse team may also determine that tags need to be added to or edited in an item of content.  For more information, please see the <a href="#ratings">ratings/warnings section</a>.</p>


<p>If content violating the <acronym>ToS</acronym> is posted anonymously or with invalid contact information, it will be removed without prior notice.</p>


<p>If the complainant requests notification of the resolution of the complaint and provides contact information, we will notify him or her.</p>


<p>3. <em>Submitting an appeal</em></p>


<p>The complainant or the original poster may appeal a decision to the abuse team as a whole.  During the appeal, the original decision will remain in effect.  We will attempt to resolve appeals as speedily as possible, but please remember that we are all volunteers.  The abuse team's decisions are final unless overturned by the Board at the Board's sole discretion.  There is no right of appeal to the Board.  The abuse team, however, may consult with the Board or with committee members authorized by the Board if the abuse team decides that consultation would help resolve an issue.</p>


<p>4. <em>Account statuses</em></p>


<p>"Account status" refers to the existence of warnings on an account and whether that account has been suspended, temporarily or permanently (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'account_status') -%>).</p>


<p>The abuse team may issue warnings when it determines that a violation of the <acronym>ToS</acronym> was minor or unintentional.  More serious, intentional, or repeated violations of the <acronym>ToS</acronym> will trigger suspensions.  A suspension will generally be for a period of time, such as a month.  The abuse team may also permanently suspend users when it determines that permanent suspension is justified. Permanent suspensions for violations other than spam or threatening the technical integrity of the site require a majority vote of the abuse team.  The abuse team's discretion will be informed by the nature of the violation and the response of the user, including the user's decision to voluntarily remove the content that violates the <acronym>ToS</acronym>.</p>


<p>A user whose account has been permanently suspended may not rejoin under another identity.</p>


<p>Where possible, we encourage users to try mediating disputes before contacting Abuse.  We provide tools for registered users to control Content that is uploaded in their own spaces.  For example, users are able to delete comments on their own stories.  If you are unable to resolve the problem on your own, you can file a complaint with the volunteer abuse team.</p>


<p>In some cases, objectionable content may have already been deleted before the abuse team acts. We appreciate good faith attempts to resolve disputes, and in most such cases will close the abuse complaint with no further action. However, we reserve the right to consider individual circumstances, including whether the poster has engaged in a pattern of such conduct. In such cases, if we verify that the original content violated the <acronym>ToS</acronym>, we may still decide to warn or suspend the original poster.</p>


<p>Penalties apply to users, not to screen names/pseudonyms.  Penalties are not retroactive: a suspended user's nonobjectionable content will not be automatically removed. Suspended users retain the right to delete or orphan their fanworks by contacting Archive adminstrators.</p>


<p>B.    <a name="spam"><strong>Spam and commercial promotion</strong></a></p>


<p>Promotion of commercial products or activities is not allowed.  Repeated identical posts in multiple places, e.g., a large number of identical comments promoting a website, will also be considered spam regardless of commercial content.</p>


<p>Anything we determine is spam will be removed immediately.  Deletion and suspension decisions will not be subject to the two-person review process described above. Users may be permanently suspended for spam the first time they post spam content.</p>


<p>In general, unsolicited commercial activity is not permitted on the Archive. The abuse team has discretion to decide that a fan-related offer was mistakenly disseminated and issue a warning instead of a suspension.</p>


<p>Any spam- or commercial activity-related penalties may be appealed using the ordinary appeal process.</p>


<p>We may use automated means to filter out spam.  If you submit content that is erroneously caught in a spam filter, please notify Archive administrators.</p>


<p>C.    <a name="tech"><strong>Threatening the technical integrity of the site</strong></a></p>


<p>Conduct that threatens the technical integrity of the Archive, e.g. attempts to hack the site or spread viruses through it, will result in an immediate account suspension and deletion of any content that is hazardous to the operation of the site or to users' computers.  Threats to the technical integrity of the Archive will not be subject to the two-person review process described above.  Users may be permanently suspended for threatening the technical integrity of the Archive the first time they do so.  Such suspensions may be appealed using the ordinary appeal process.</p>


<p>Uploading technically misnamed content&#8212;e.g., non-text files with a text file extension name, used to disguise their actual format&#8212;constitutes a threat to the technical integrity of the site.</p>


<p>D.    <a name="copyright"><strong>Copyright and Trademark</strong></a></p>


<p>Please be aware that the <acronym>OTW</acronym> believes that transformative fanworks are legal; therefore, complaints based merely on the existence of fanwork based on copyrighted content or mentioning trademarks will not be pursued.</p>


<p>If you believe that your content has been reproduced in whole or in part, without transformative use (transformative use is defined by the <acronym>OTW</acronym> as adding something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the source with new expression, meaning, or message), please follow our procedures for reporting copyright infringement.</p>


<p>The report must clearly and specifically indicate the exact location (URL), nature, and extent of each instance of allegedly infringing content, as well as the exact copyrighted material that is being infringed, as well as full and complete contact information for the copyright holder and/or an authorized agent.</p>


<p>Epigraphs and short quotations, including quotations from song lyrics and poetry, are allowed. Content that is set within or draws on an existing work is allowed. Reproductions of entire copyrighted works&#8212;whether songs, poems, transcripts, or other material&#8212;are not allowed without the consent of the copyright owner.</p>


<p>Please note that the first version of the Archive will only host text and user icons. Future policies will focus on other media.</p>


<p>E.    <a name="plagiarism"><strong>Plagiarism</strong></a></p>


<p>Plagiarism is an often-contested and fuzzy concept, and no definition will satisfy everyone.  Our aim is to be transparent and fair in resolving disputes.</p>


<p>Plagiarism is the use of someone else's words or concepts without properly attributing those words or concepts to their original source. Simply finding and replacing names, substituting synonyms, or rearranging a few words is not enough to make the work original to you. Deliberately writing a work using the same general idea as another work is not plagiarism, but citation is always appreciated. Generally, quotes from the source material (canon) on which the content is based will not constitute plagiarism, nor will obvious allusions ("Use the Force, Luke!"). However, when in doubt, cite.</p>


<p>Plagiarism is a violation of the <acronym>ToS</acronym> and will incur the penalties described in the abuse policy. As with all content that violates the <acronym>ToS</acronym>, plagiarized content must be removed. Depending on the type and amount of plagiarized content, this might entail removing an entire piece of content, removing only the plagiarized portions from a longer work while leaving the original material, or adding citations.</p>


<p>If you believe a fanwork posted on the Archive plagiarizes another work, please report the work to <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/en/abuse">the abuse team</a>. In order to allow us to investigate, please provide a link to the work on the Archive, relevant excerpts, and a specific citation of the original material (for example, a URL or a book edition and page number).</p>


<p>F.    <a name="personal"><strong>Personal information and fannish identities</strong></a></p>


<p>The <acronym>OTW</acronym> is committed to protecting the privacy of our users, including the separation many fans choose to keep between their legal, "real life" names and their fannish pseudonyms.  Unauthorized disclosure of a fan's personal information is a violation of the Terms of Service.  For these purposes, "personal information" may include legal names and other information sufficient to identify a person in the physical world that he or she has not voluntarily shared on the Archive itself.  "Personal information" may also include the identity of the creator of an orphaned fanwork.</p>


<p>G.    <a name="harassment"><strong>Harassment</strong></a></p>


<p>Harassment is any behavior that produces a generally hostile environment for its target.  This includes activities such as bullying and hazing by groups of people as well as personal attacks by individuals.  Not everyone agrees about what is offensive and unacceptable. Individual users are encouraged to try to resolve problems on their own before contacting the abuse team.</p>


<p>Harassment is not allowed.  Users engaging in this behavior may be warned, suspended, or permanently suspended as described in the general abuse procedure.</p>


<p>When judging whether a specific incident constitutes harassment, the abuse team will consider factors such as whether the behavior was repeated, whether it was repeated after the offender was asked to stop, whether the behavior was targeted at a specific person, whether that target could have easily avoided encountering the behavior, whether the behavior would be considered unacceptable according to normal community standards, etc. Additionally, making complaints that are both (a) repeated and (b) baseless, particularly those targeting a specific user, can be considered harassing behavior and may be deemed a violation of the <acronym>ToS</acronym>.</p>


<p>While these complaints will be reviewed on a case by case basis, in general, threatening content will be considered harassment, while content that is merely annoying will be allowed.  Please note that most statements like "X is a terrible actor and should die!" are not death threats.  Writing a story where X dies as part of the plot is also not usually a death threat.  Content that is harder to avoid (such as comments on the target's fanworks) will be judged more strictly than content that is easily avoidable (such as stories).</p>


<p>The behavior of the original poster (the complaint subject) may also affect the abuse team's determination.  If the original poster repeatedly contacts the subject of the content about the content after being told to stop, harasses the subject, or requests that others harass the subject, the content may be considered part of a general pattern of harassment and be removed.  Please use your best judgment both when producing content of this type and when reporting it.</p>


<p><em>A special note on <acronym title="real-person fiction">RPF</acronym> (real-person fiction):</em></p>


<p>Writing <acronym>RPF </acronym> (real-person fiction) never constitutes harassment in and of itself.  However, content that advocates specific, real harmful actions towards real people is not allowed.  This includes, but is not limited to, death threats and requests for readers to harass specific people.  If you find content that you believe contains harassing or threatening material, please <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/en/abuse">contact the abuse team</a>.</p>

<p>1. Introduction</p>


<p>a.    <strong>We will not require specific ratings or warnings.  However, a creator who chooses not to use ratings or warnings on a fanwork must signal this choice</strong> (<%= link_to 'see the faq', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'ratings_and_warnings') -%>).<br />b.    By default, all users will see the warnings the creator has selected.  Any logged-in user who wishes to avoid warnings may set preferences to hide warnings by default.  You can set your preferences to hide warnings by default.  Logged-in users who set their preferences to hide warnings are proceeding at their own risk and may be exposed to content they would otherwise wish to avoid.  Such users may change their preferences, or reveal warnings, at any time.<br />c.    Logged-in users may set their preferences to indicate that they are willing to see mature or explicit content.  <br />d.  Other users, including users who are not registered users of the site, who follow a link to a fanwork rated mature, explicit, or "not rated," will be asked to agree to see mature, explicit, or unrated content.  The Archive software will remember a non-registered user's choice during that user's visit, but will not retain the setting for future visits.</p>


<p>2. Ratings</p>


<p>a.  The Archive uses the following ratings:</p>


<p>i.    General audiences&mdashthe content is generally suitable for any audience.<br />ii.    Teen and up audiences&mdashthe content may be inappropriate for audiences under 13. <br />iii.    Mature&mdashthe content deals with adult concepts (violence,  sex, or other similar content).<br />iv.    Explicit&mdashthe content features explicit/graphic violence, sex, or other similar content.<br />v.    Not rated&mdashthe author has chosen not to rate.  This may be content of any type.</p>


<p>b.  As a rule, the creator controls the rating.</p>


<p>In response to a complaint, the abuse team may decide that a "general" or "teen" rating is misleading.  In such cases, the creator may be required to change the rating.  If the creator declines or fails to respond, the abuse team may set the rating at "not rated."  The abuse team's authority extends only to changing a rating to "not rated," not to selecting any other rating.</p>


<p>c.  The meaning of "not rated" :</p>


<p>Fanworks labeled "not rated" may be treated, for purposes of searching, screening, and other Archive functions, like "explicit"-rated fanworks.  Thus, users may be asked to agree that they have chosen to access the fanwork before proceeding to the fanwork.</p>


<p>3.  Warnings</p>


<p>a.  General description:</p>


<p>There are two components to the warning tags.  <br />i. Primary tags: Creators can select from a <%= link_to 'list of common warnings', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'tags') -%>. The list also allows creators to select "choose not to warn," "choose not to warn for some content," and "none of these warnings apply."  <br />ii. Secondary (optional) tags: Creators can define their own tags, as seriously or as humorously as they like.  These can include specific content warnings or promises.  The warnings policy only covers 
<%= link_to 'primary tags', tos_faq_path(:anchor => 'primary_tags') -%>.

<p>b.  As a rule, the creator controls the warnings</p>

<p>Selecting one of the "choose not to warn" options satisfies a creator's obligation under the warnings policy.  If a fanwork uses a "choose not to warn" option, we will not sustain any failure-to-warn complaints.  If the abuse team receives a failure-to-warn complaint when a creator has not used one of the "choose not to warn" options, the abuse team may decide the absence of a specific warning from the primary list (part one) is misleading.  In such cases, the creator may be asked to add a warning or to select "choose not to warn for some content."  If the creator declines or fails to respond, the abuse team may set the rating at "choose not to warn for some content."  The abuse team's authority extends only to changing a warning to "choose not to warn for some content," not to selecting any other warning.</p>


<p>c.  The meaning of "choose not to warn" or "choose not to warn for some content" :</p>


<p>Both terms mean that the fanwork may contain any of the other contents on the primary list.  Users who wish to avoid specific elements entirely should not access fanworks marked with "choose not to warn" or "choose not to warn for some content."  The difference between the two is that "choose not to warn" can be used in lieu of all warnings.  "Choose not to warn for some content" can be used when the author wants to use some warnings, but perhaps not all that might apply.</p>


<p>4.  Consequence of failure to use an appropriate rating or warning</p>


<p>In general, failure to use an appropriate rating or warning is not a violation of the abuse policy.</p>


<p>It is our policy to defer to creators' categorizations, but we reserve the right to recategorize a fanwork in two situations.  (1) When we determine that a complaint about a "general" or "teen and up" rating is valid, we may change the rating to "not rated." (2) When we determine that a complaint about a failure to warn for content on the primary tag list is valid, we may add "choose not to warn for some content" to the warnings.  The abuse team will not pick a more specific rating or warning for a fanwork.</p>


<p>A recategorization decision is appealable through the ordinary abuse appeals process.</p>


<p>A recategorization of a fanwork will not result in suspension of a user's account, unless it is a repeated pattern for a single user, in which case it may be treated as grounds for a suspension. Moreover, if a creator unilaterally reverses a recategorization, without agreement from the abuse team, that will be treated as grounds for a suspension.</p>
