acts_as_authenticated (altered for OTW purposes!)
=====================

-Using SHA1 instead of Bcrypt, due to Windows compatibility issues 
-Separated remember me functionality into its own module
-Split features for users and admins: users get remember me and activation columns; admins get their own authentication methods

=====================

Old README:

Largely based on restful_authentication by Rick Olson. Changes include:

  * Bcrypt is used for password storage.
  * Specified with RSpec.
  * Authentication mechanisms are separated into
    modules contained within the plugin.
  * Generators are only used for migrations.
  * Does not include email verification.

This plugin does not generate controller code for you. Partly because
I'm lazy and partly since example code (taken from restful_authentication)
can be found in the resources directory of the plugins spec folder.

For a rationale on why SHA1 with individual salts is sub-par to bcrypt
read Thomas Ptacek's article[1].

Example
=======

Using acts_as_authentable is as easy as:

Installing bcrypt-ruby:

  gem install bcrypt-ruby

Installing acts_as_authentable:

  ./script/plugin install http://acts-as-authentable.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/acts_as_authentable

Annotate the model object you want to be authentable:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_authentable
  end

Creating a migration for adding fields to the authentable model: 

  ./script/generate authentable user

    creates a migration:
      db/migrate/XXX_add_authentable_fields_for_users.rb

If you have rspec and rspec_on_rails installed verify the plugin with:

  rake spec:plugins
