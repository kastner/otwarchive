<h3>Publication Date Options</h3>

<p>
When posting a work, you have the option to set a different publication date 
- in other words, to backdate the work. You can also set publication dates for 
individual chapters. Please note that in both cases, this affects whether and where 
your work appears on your dashboard and the works page, etc. These pages which show 
the date when your work was last updated - the publication date of your work or 
of one of your chapters, whichever is the most recent date. 
</p>

<p>
The work form also has a "Set this publication date for the entire work" option. 
If you check this box when posting a work, any subsequent chapters you add will have 
that date pre-set on the form, though you will still have the option of 
overriding that date. This means that if you don't know or care exactly when each 
chapter was originally published, you can still backdate your work conveniently.	
</p>

<p>
If you edit a posted work and check the "Set this publication date for the entire work" 
box, your work will show this date on your dashboard and the works page, etc. 
The dates you have set on your chapters will not be changed. If you subsequently 
edit the work to uncheck this box, the work will show on your dashboard as having 
been revised at the most recent of the dates you've set on your chapters.
