<h3>Warning Tags</h3>

<dl id="help">
	<dt>Choose Not To Warn:</dt>
	<dd>
	Use this if you don't want to warn for anything (because you don't like warnings, because you're avoiding spoilers, etc.).
	</dd>
	<dt>Choose Not To Warn For Some Content:</dt>
	<dd>
	Use this if you want to use some warnings but
not others (because you don't like warning for certain topics, because you're
avoiding some spoilers but not others, etc.).
	</dd>
	<dt>None Of These Warnings Apply:</dt>
	<dd>
	Use this if the other warnings don't apply to your
content (in other words, if it contains no graphic depictions of violence, major character death,
rape/non-con, or underage sexuality).
	</dd>
	<dt>Graphic Depictions of Violence:</dt>
	<dd>
	This is for gory, graphic, explicitly described violence.  Exactly
where to draw the line is your call.
	</dd>
	<dt>Major Character Death:</dt>
	<dd>
	Please use your best judgment about who counts as a major
character.
	</dd>
	<dt>Rape/Non-Con:</dt>
	<dd>
		Again, this is your call.  If you think your content is borderline
non-con, but you don't feel like using this warning (or you're not sure if you
should), you always have the option of using "choose not to warn" or "choose not to
warn for some content" instead.
	</dd>
	<dt>Underage:</dt>
	<dd>
		This is for descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters
under the age of eighteen (this does not include dating activity like kissing or
vague references with no actual description/depiction).  This generally applies to
humans: If you are writing porn about space aliens who only live for a month or
thousand year-old vampires with twelve year-old bodies, please just use your best
judgment.  You are always free to specify characters' ages or to use "choose not to
warn" or "choose not to warn for some content".
	</dd>
