    'I hope we'll see you at this year's Dance Marathon,' Taylor says, cheerfully officious as usual.
    
    'I'm not sure...' Rory begins, feeling herself flush red. She hasn't been for years, not since that one disastrous night, and she'd rather not be reminded of that now.
    
    'Rory, I thought we could rely on <em>you</em> to uphold the town's traditions.' Taylor draws himself up, ready to deliver a lecture.
    
    Dean cuts him off. 'Of course we'll be there. We're gonna win, right, Rory?'
    
    'Right,' she agrees, and slips her hand into his.
    
    After all, he's already outlasted everyone else.

    'Tell me.' Jensen's voice is harsh, inflexible as the hold he's got on Jared's wrists. He squeezes Jared's cock with his other hand, jerks him once, agonisingly slowly, tightening his fist again when Jared tries to buck up into his grip.
    
    'Tell me what you were doing,' he says again. He leans in close and sucks at Jared's neck, teeth scraping just right along the thin skin over Jared's pulse.
    
    'Trying - trying to make you jealous.' Jared's already close to losing it, gasping as Jensen jerks his cock again, thumb slipping up to rub across the head. 'Pay me some - oh - some attention, 'stead of talking with Chris all night.'
    
    'Pay you some attention?' Jensen gives him a long look, green eyes considering, weighing Jared up. 'Okay.'
    
    Abruptly, Jensen releases his grip on Jared. He trails his hand along Jared's side and up, teasing at a nipple till Jared cries out and surges up towards him.
    
    'Nuh-uh.' The easy tone belies the speed and strength with which Jensen catches at his wrists, bears Jared back down onto the bed.
    'You wanted my attention. Now you're gonna lie right there, like a good boy, while I give it to you.'
    
    Jensen keeps his hand resting heavy there a long moment, eyes locked on Jared's until Jared gives a little shiver and stops resisting, all the fight gone out of him.
    
    An hour later, Jensen pushes into him, <em>hot steady burn</em> against skin already licked and sucked oversensitive, and Jared feels himself shaking apart.
    
    He likes it when Jensen pays attention.

    <p>The tree-house is a godsend.<br /> <br /> John's boys are good kids, but they're still <em>kids</em>, full of energy and liable to get into every which thing. It's a marvel John can keep them under control as well as he does; Dean with his itching desire to take apart any goddamned piece of machinery he sees, whole Sam trails around after him getting into everything and asking questions until it's enough to drive a man to drink. It wouldn't be so bad if he and John were just working in the yard - Dean at least is plenty old enough to learn his way around the innards of a car; pretty handy at it, too - but if the case they're working as anything John could do in front of the boys, he probably wouldn't be here.</p>
    <p><br /> The first week they're happy enough exploring the yard, scoping out their territory. Dean sets to climbing every tree in the orchard, Sammy following doggedly behind him, red-faced and determined as he struggles to keep up. They tackle all the little fruit trees first, leaving the ash tree out on the west of the property till last. It's not the hardest tree to climb, but it's the biggest, been there longer than the house has. Dean shins up the trunk first and ties a rope to the lowest branch, but Sam ignores the help, kicking off his shoes so he can dig toes as well as fingers into the cracks in the bark. When he finally makes it he persuades Dean to carve both their initials into the bark, and they both sit there all afternoon, grinning out over the valley.</p>
    <p align="center"><br /> Once they've cracked the ash tree, though, they're both back to poking around the yard, looking for mischief to get into. So when John leans back one evening and says, 'Used to build treehouses when I was a kid', Bobby seizes on it for the inspiration it is.</p>
    <p align="right"><br /> "Built one or two myself. We had a great treehouse out on my granddaddy's old place, big enough me and both my brothers could fit it." He takes a long pull on his beer, pretending like he can't see the way Dean and Sammy have both pricked up their ears. "He had a big old ash tree, like that one out back."<br /> <br /></p>
    <ul>
    <li>John nods wisely, the corner of his mouth twitching as he says, "Yeah, that's the right kind of tree, sure enough."</li>
    <li>Sam lets out a little squeak of excitement, and Bobby has to take another drink before he can compose himself enough to speak. "'Course, it was a mighty lot of work. Can't think kids nowadays would have the sticking power."</li>
    <li>"<em>We</em> would, Uncle Bobby!" Sam bursts out. "We could build one, couldn't we, Dean?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Dean shushes him, saying, "It's not our tree, Sam," but his face is just as shining and hopeful as his brother's.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Bobby catches John's eye. "I got no objections."</li>
    <li>Finally he relents. "If you really want to do this, you've gotta do it right, you hear? That means you too, Sammy. You mind what your brother tells you."</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br /> <br /> <strong>He fixes Dean with a stern look. "And you look after your brother. We don't need any broken necks."</strong><br /> <br /> <u>The two of them <em>yessir</em> and <em>nosir</em>, nodding fervently, and the second John dismisses them they burst out into the yard, already arguing about the best way to plan the project and whether or not it's dumb to give the tree-house windows.</u> Bobby remembers that the first time he built a tree-house, he dragged half the lumber he could find up the tree before stopping to figure out how it would all fit together, but Dean and Sam have the whole thing sketched out on paper before they even start looking for materials. And if the yard yields some surprisingly useful scraps - well, it just goes to show that planning pays off.<br /> <br /> <strike>Between keeping an eye on the boys and finding ways to keep them well-supplied with building materials, Bobby and John finish up the job they've been working on. The demon they've been after leaves them both bloody and exhausted</strike> before they manage to send it back to hell, but even so, it's only a couple of days before John's edgy and restless, hunting through newspapers and clipping out obituaries and disappearances.<br /> <br /> When he starts hunting through the maps,</p>
    <p>looking for one of Ohio,</p>
    <p>Bobby observes mildly,</p>
    <p>"They've only just finished that tree-house."</p>
    <p><br /> "I know," John says regretfully, but he doesn't stop comparing the scribbled notes he's made against the unfolded map.</p>

    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>John does pause   then, looks up slowly, like if he moves too quick Bobby'll take it back.   "You're a good man, Bobby."</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>"Not   particularly." Bobby fishes in his pocket for his pack of cigarettes, a   habit he still hasn't gotten around to quitting. "Just mind you pick   them up before the school year starts."</strong></p>

    <p><strong>John leaves the   boys at the yard the next summer, too, but the one after that he calls and   says he's keeping them with him, holing up in a cabin in the woods somewhere   while he hunts down a possible Raksha. "The boys are old enough   now," he says. "Dean can handle a gun like you wouldn't believe."</strong></p>

    <p><strong>They don't come   by that summer, though, and by the next they're on the other side of the   country, and Bobby's busy with his own affairs. He sees them off and on over   the next few years, but always for one-off jobs, and they don't make it back   to his place. Figures that John's heard the message in Bobby's silences and   chosen to deal with it his own way.</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><br /> He's less surprised than he should be when the letters start to arrive. The   first two he just stashes in the bookcase and forgets about. When the third   one arrives, though - thick and heavy with promises - he picks up the phone.   He doesn't need the return address on that thick envelope - <em>Stanford University</em> - to tell him that   John doesn't need to know about the letters. Instead he says, "Got a job   I could use your help with," brushing aside John's surprise at the call.<br /> <br /></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><br /> It's a shock when Bobby makes the rendezvous to find John standing there with   two young men. Not like he didn't know the boys were growing up, but there's   knowing and then there's seeing Dean standing shoulder-to-shoulder with John,   plotting out hunt strategies while Sammy towers over them both.<br /> <br /></p>

    <p>So, my name's Jessica Moore, and it you know anything about me at all you'll know I died. A few years ago now, actually, and I'm as surprised as anyone to find that apparently that doesn't preclude me walking and talking and all that.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It apparently precludes me touching anyone else, though, which sucks. Particularly since that pretty much rules out continuing with the awesomely hot sex I was enjoying with Sam Winchester.</p>

  summary: 
  content: "Well, the Lord is pretty forgiving as a rule, but this was back in the old days, when he wasn't given to pussyfooting around, and things had gotten pretty corrupt in Sodom and Gomorrah - not to mention Admah, Zeboim, and Bela. The drinking, whoring and general depravity was bad enough, but what really set these guys apart was the way they trampled on their own. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Anyway, finally things got to a bad enough pass that the Lord sent me down with some of the boys to take care of things. Of course, these mud monkeys never can accept these things, and when Abaraham got wind of it he begged the Lord to reconsider. Well, at the time the Lord was thinking up this other plan, about being made flesh and all that, so he says if Abraham could find more than a handful of righteous souls in one of these cities then he'd think again on the wholesale smiting. He could only find the one, though - this guy Lot - so that was off.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To do Lot justice, he was okay. When me and the boys went down to give him fair warning, the degenerates in Sodom got pretty interested. We used to pick good looking vessels, back in the day (well, some of us still do, but these days I go for inspiring respect rather than a pretty face). So, they came baying at the doors, asking for a piece of us. Lot, though, he knew his duty, and he wasn't going to insult the Lord like that. He offered up his daughters instead, mind you. Mud monkeys, they make no sense to me. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Since Lot was a good sort, we got him and his people out of the city. Told them not to look back, too, because we were planning some pretty righteous smiting. Of course, there always has to be one who doesn't listen, and sure enough his wife had to turn back. Pillar of salted her: regrettable, but what can you do? People should follow instructions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So, we did some flattening of the city - fire, brimstone, the whole works. Some of the best fun I've had in eternity, I have to admit. Lot was well out of it, but those daughters of his took some fool notion to have a baby, and he was the only man around. So it goes. "

    Rory's already in bed when Dean comes up, sprawled on top of the covers with her nose in a book. She looks up when he settles on the edge of the bed, sticks her finger in the book to mark her place while she gives him a quick kiss, then goes back to reading.
    
    Dean rests his hand on Rory's thigh, sliding it up under fabric and savoring the warm smoothness of her skin. "Stealing my shorts again," he remarks, and she <i>hmms</i> in response, wriggling a little against the pressure of his hand without pausing in her reading. He pulls away and strips off his clothes, gyrating theatrically and flinging his pants across the room to try and make her look up. Rory keeps her eyes firmly on the book, but when he rips off his shorts and wiggles his hips right by her face, he's rewarded by the ghost of a smile.
    
    "There's a naked man in your room!" Dean raises his hands in mock horror. "Aren't you going to protect your maidenly honor?"
    
    "That ship has sailed," Rory says wryly. "But I may be moved to strong measures to protect my maidenly reading privileges." Her voice goes high and breathy on the last word as Dean licks a long stripe along her neck, though, and when he slides his hand between her legs she shifts them wider.
    
    Dean rubs his thumb along the crease where her thigh meets her ass, sliding lower and lower till he can feel the heat of her. He holds his hand there, heavy and unmoving, and says regretfully to the room, "Nothing I can do that can compete with a book."
    
    "It's sadly true," Rory says, but she's definitely smiling now, and she hasn't turned a page for at least two minutes.
    
    Dean nibbles gently at her ear and slides his hand a little further, just the tip of his thumb nudging her wetness. When she moans and shifts back into him Dean rolls closer, pressing his cock into the warmth of her leg. He kisses along her spine, grinning against her skin as her breath starts to come faster. He waits until she tenses, about to turn to kiss him, and pulls away.
    
    "Guess I'll just have to amuse myself," he says mournfully.
    
    Rory laughs and bats his hand away from his cock, little hands wrapping around him. Dean barely suppresses his moan when he feels her mouth join them.
    
    Half an hour later, they're both flushed and panting, lying sticky and boneless in a tumble of sheets.
    
    "Jesus Christ," Dean breathes. "Where do you learn these things?"
    
    Rory smirks and kisses him. "I get them out of books."

    [002] Ended the king's long story, with which all seemed to be very well pleased, quoth Dioneo with a laugh: \"The good man that looked that night to cause the bogey's tail to droop, would scarce have contributed two pennyworth of all the praise you bestow on Messer Torello:\" then, witting that it now only remained for him to tell, thus he began:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [003] Gentle my ladies, this day, meseems, is dedicate to Kings and Soldans and folk of the like quality; wherefore, that I stray not too far from you, I am minded to tell you somewhat of a Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but a piece of mad folly, albeit there came good thereof to him in the end. The which I counsel none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it turned out well with him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [004] There was in olden days a certain Marquis of Saluzzo, Gualtieri by name, a young man, but head of the house, who, having neither wife nor child, passed his time in nought else but in hawking and hunting, and of taking a wife and begetting children had no thought; wherein he should have been accounted very wise: [005] but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes entreat him to take a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and they be left without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern, and of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be well content with the sequel. [006] To whom: \"My friends,\" replied Gualtieri, \"you enforce me to that which I had resolved never to do, seeing how hard it is to find a wife, whose ways accord well with one's own, and how plentiful is the supply of such as run counter thereto, and how grievous a life he leads who chances upon a lady that matches ill with him. [007] And to say that you think to know the daughters by the qualities of their fathers and mothers, and thereby--so you would argue--to provide me with a wife to my liking, is but folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate the secrets of their mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted that you do know them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their parents. [008] However, as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am content that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but myself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of my own choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom I choose, if she receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you shall prove to your great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained by your importunity to take a wife against my will.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    The worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he would marry without more ado. [009] And Gualtieri, who had long noted with approval the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by his house, and found her fair enough, deemed that with her he might pass a tolerably happy life. Wherefore he sought no further, but forthwith resolved to marry her; and having sent for her father, who was a very poor man, he contracted with him to take her to wife. [010] Which done, Gualtieri assembled all the friends he had in those parts, and: \"My friends,\" quoth he, \"you were and are minded that I should take a wife, and rather to comply with your wishes, than for any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my mind to do so. [011] You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that, whomsoever I should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady. Which promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am to keep mine. [012] I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own heart, whom I purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my house in the course of a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how you may make the nuptial feast splendid, and welcome her with all honour; that I may confess myself satisfied with your observance of your promise, as you will be with my observance of mine.\"[013] The worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity that they were well content, and that, whoever she might be, they would entreat her as a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which, they all addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration of the event, as did also Gualtieri. [014] He arranged for a wedding most stately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and kinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood; and therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and fashioned to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions as the girl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store, besides, of girdles and rings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and all the other paraphernalia of a bride.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [015] The day that he had appointed for the wedding being come, about half tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to do him honour, and having made all needful dispositions: \"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"'tis time to go bring home the bride.\" And so away he rode with his company to the village; [016] where, being come to the house of the girl's father, they found her returning from the spring with a bucket of water, making all the haste she could, that she might afterwards go with the other women to see Gualtieri's bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called her by her name, to wit, Griselda, and asked her where her father was. To whom she modestly made answer: \"My lord, he is in the house.\"[017] Whereupon Gualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await him without, entered the cottage alone; and meeting her father, whose name was Giannucolo: \"I am come,\" quoth he, \"to wed Griselda, but first of all there are some matters I would learn from her own lips in thy presence.\"[018] He then asked her, whether, if he took her to wife, she would study to comply with his wishes, and be not wroth, no matter what he might say or do, and be obedient, with not a few other questions of a like sort: to all which she answered, ay. [019] Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led her forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other folk as were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the garments that he had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith arrayed therein, and upon her unkempt head let set a crown; [020] and then, while all wondered: \"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"this is she whom I purpose to make my wife, so she be minded to have me for husband.\" Then, she standing abashed and astonied, he turned to her, saying: \"Griselda, wilt thou have me for thy husband?\"[021] To whom: \"Ay, my lord,\" answered she. [022] \"And I will have thee to wife,\" said he, and married her before them all. And having set her upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [023] The wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter of the King of France, the feast could not have been more splendid. [024] It seemed as if, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired a new dignity of mind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of form and feature; and therewithal she was now grown so engaging and gracious and debonair, that she shewed no longer as the shepherdess, and the daughter of Giannucolo, but as the daughter of some noble lord, insomuch that she caused as many as had known her before to marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and devoted to her husband, that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest man in the world. [025] And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her husband's vassals, that there was none of them but loved her more dearly than himself, and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her welfare and prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile, saying that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment, for that, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained hidden under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl. [026] And in short she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it to pass that, not only in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her virtues and her admirable conversation were matter of common talk, and, if aught had been said to the disadvantage of her husband, when he married her, the judgment was now altogether to the contrary effect.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [027] She had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and in due time she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great cheer. But, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him, to wit, to put her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable hard usage; wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes, putting on a vexed air, and telling her that his vassals were most sorely dissatisfied with her by reason of her base condition, and all the more so since they saw that she was a mother, and that they did nought but most ruefully murmur at the birth of a daughter. [028] Whereto Griselda, without the least change of countenance or sign of discomposure, made answer: \"My lord, do with me as thou mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot that I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.\"[029] By which answer Gualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree puffed up with pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment of her. [030] A while afterwards, having in general terms given his wife to understand that the vassals could not endure her daughter, he sent her a message by a servant. So the servant came, and: \"Madam,\" quoth he with a most dolorous mien, \"so I value my life, I must needs do my lord's bidding. He has bidden me take your daughter and . . .\"[031] He said no more, but the lady by what she heard, and read in his face, and remembered of her husband's words, understood that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon she presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and blessed her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not countenance, but placed it in the servant's arms, saying: [032] \"See that thou leave nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he have so bidden thee.\"[033] So the servant took the child, and told Gualtieri what the lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her constancy, sent him with the child to Bologna, to one of his kinswomen, whom he besought to rear and educate the child with all care, but never to let it be known whose child she was.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [034] Soon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due time was delivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But, not content with what he had done, he now even more poignantly afflicted the lady; and one day with a ruffled mien: [035] \"Wife,\" quoth he, \"since thou gavest birth to this boy, I may on no wise live in peace with my vassals, so bitterly do they reproach me that a grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed me as their lord; and therefore I fear that, so I be not minded to be sent a packing hence, I must even do herein as I did before, and in the end put thee away, and take another wife.\"[036] The lady heard him patiently, and answered only: \"My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best please thyself, and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I desire save in so far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.\"[037] Not many days after, Gualtieri, in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent for the son, and having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for his, as for the girl's, nurture at Bologna. [038] Whereat the lady shewed no more discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her daughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed that there was never another woman in the world that would have so done. And but that he had marked that she was most tenderly affectionate towards her children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he had supposed that she was tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas of her discretion that she so did. [039] His vassals, who believed that he had put the children to death, held him mightily to blame for his cruelty, and felt the utmost compassion for the lady. She, however, said never aught to the ladies that condoled with her on the death of her children, but that the pleasure of him that had begotten them was her pleasure likewise.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [040] Years not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri at length deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the final proof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his vassals he declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have Griselda to wife, that he confessed that in taking her he had done a sorry thing and the act of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to do what he could to procure the Pope's dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another wife: for which cause being much upbraided by many worthy men, he made no other answer but only that needs must it so be. [041] Whereof the lady being apprised, and now deeming that she must look to go back to her father's house, and perchance tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him, to whom she was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly bewail herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with which she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure this last outrage. [042] Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit letters, which he caused to be sent to him from Rome, made his vassals believe that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused her to be brought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a few: [043] \"Wife, by license granted me by the Pope, I am now free to put thee away, and take another wife; and, for that my forbears have always been great gentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas thine have ever been husbandmen, I purpose that thou go back to Giannucolo's house with the dowry that thou broughtest me; whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I have found, and who is meet to be my wife.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [044] 'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she heard this announcement, got the better of her woman's nature, and suppressing her tears, made answer: \"My lord, I ever knew that my low degree was on no wise congruous with your nobility, and acknowledged that the rank I had with you was of your and God's bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it were mine by gift, or so esteem it, but still accounted it as a loan. 'Tis your pleasure to recall it, and therefore it should be, and is, my pleasure to render it up to you. So, here is your ring, with which you espoused me; take it back. [045] You bid me take with me the dowry that I brought you; which to do will require neither paymaster on your part nor purse nor packhorse on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when you first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I have borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I depart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity that I brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence upon my back a single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.\"[046] There was nought of which Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but yet, setting his face as a flint, he made answer: \"I allow thee a shift to thy back; so get thee hence.\"[047] All that stood by besought him to give her a robe, that she, who had been his wife for thirteen years and more, might not be seen to quit his house in so sorry and shameful a plight, having nought on her but a shift. But their entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and barefoot and bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and went back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw her. [048] Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible that Gualtieri should keep his daughter to wife, and had looked for this to happen every day, and had kept the clothes that she had put off on the morning that Gualtieri had wedded her, now brought them to her; and she, having resumed them, applied herself to the petty drudgery of her father's house, as she had been wont, enduring with fortitude this cruel visitation of adverse Fortune.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [049] Now no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed Griselda, than he gave his vassals to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of the Counts of Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as for the nuptials, during which he sent for Griselda. To whom, being come, quoth he: [050] \"I am bringing hither my new bride, and in this her first home-coming I purpose to shew her honour; and thou knowest that women I have none in the house that know how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other matters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that understandest these things better than another, see to all that needs be done, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and receive them, as if thou wert the lady of the house, and then, when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.\"[051] Albeit each of these words pierced Griselda's heart like a knife, for that, in resigning her good fortune, she had not been able to renounce the love she bore Gualtieri, nevertheless: \"My lord,\" she made answer, \"I am ready and prompt to do your pleasure.\"[052] And so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole, she entered the house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her shift, and addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and cushions in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to everything, as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the occasion demanded. [053] This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all the ladies of those parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the event. The day being come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in heart and soul and mien the lady, she received the ladies as they came, and gave each a gladsome greeting.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [054] Now Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at Bologna, which kinswoman was married into the family of the Counts of Panago; and, the girl being now twelve years old, and the loveliest creature that ever was seen, and the boy being about six years old, he had sent word to his kinswoman's husband at Bologna, praying him to be pleased to come with this girl and boy of his to Saluzzo, and to see that he brought a goodly and honourable company with him, and to give all to understand that he brought the girl to him to wife, and on no wis\xC3\xA8 to disclose to any, who she really was. [055] The gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of his setting forth arrived at Saluzzo about breakfast-time with the girl, and her brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of those parts, and much people besides, gathered there in expectation of Gualtieri's new bride. [056] Who, being received by the ladies, was no sooner come into the hall, where the tables were set, than Griselda advanced to meet her, saying with hearty cheer: \"Welcome, my lady.\" So the ladies, who had with much instance, but in vain, besought Gualtieri, either to let Griselda keep in another room, or at any rate to furnish her with one of the robes that had been hers, that she might not present herself in such a sorry guise before the strangers, sate down to table; and the service being begun, [057] the eyes of all were set on the girl, and every one said that Gualtieri had made a good exchange, and Griselda joined with the rest in greatly commending her, and also her little brother. [058] And now Gualtieri, sated at last with all that he had seen of his wife's patience, marking that this new and strange turn made not the least alteration in her demeanour, and being well assured that 'twas not due to apathy, for he knew her to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time to relieve her of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a resolute front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all, he said with a smile: \"And what thinkst thou of our bride?\"[059] \"My lord,\" replied Griselda, \"I think mighty well of her; and if she be but as discreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no doubt but you may reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable felicity; but with all earnestness I entreat you, that you spare her those tribulations which you did once inflict upon another that was yours, for I scarce think she would be able to bear them, as well because she is younger, as for that she has been delicately nurtured, whereas that other had known no respite of hardship since she was but a little child.\"[060] Marking that she made no doubt but that the girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit the less sweetly, Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him, and: [061] \"Griselda,\" said he, \"'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy long patience, and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and insensate, should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought, for that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou mightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how to take and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace with thee for the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when I came to take a wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to put the matter to the proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass and afflict thee. [062] And since I never knew thee either by deed or by word to deviate from my will, I now, deeming myself to have of thee that assurance of happiness which I desired, am minded to restore to thee at once all that, step by step, I took from thee, and by extremity of joy to compensate the tribulations that I inflicted on thee. [063] Receive, then, this girl, whom thou supposest to be my bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy children and mine. These are they, whom by thee and many another it has long been supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband, that loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is none that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [064] Which said, he embraced and kissed her; and then, while she wept for joy, they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter, all astonied to hear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly embraced, and explained to them, and many others that stood by, the whole mystery. [065] Whereat the ladies, transported with delight, rose from table and betook them with Griselda to a chamber, and, with better omen, divested her of her sorry garb, and arrayed her in one of her own robes of state; and so, in guise of a lady (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they led her back into the hall. [066] Wondrous was the cheer which there they made with the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and made merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days; and very discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected Griselda, and most discreet beyond all compare they accounted Griselda.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [067] Some days after, the Count of Panago returned to Bologna, and Gualtieri took Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him in honour as his father-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived for the rest of his days. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter with a husband of high degree, lived long and happily thereafter with Griselda, to whom he ever paid all honour.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [068] Now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of the poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces of kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over men? Who but Griselda had been able, with a countenance not only tearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which Gualtieri subjected her? [069] Who perhaps might have deemed himself to have made no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who, having been turned out of his house in her shift, had found means so to dust the pelisse of another as to get herself thereby a fine robe.\r\n\

    [Voice: filostrato]
    [003] Chidden have I been so often and by so many of you for the sore burden, which I laid upon you, of discourse harsh and meet for tears, that, as some compensation for such annoy, I deem myself bound to tell you somewhat that may cause you to laugh a little: wherefore my story, which will be of the briefest, shall be of a love, the course whereof, save for sighs and a brief passage of fear mingled with shame, ran smooth to a happy consummation.
    
    [Voice: filostrato]
    [004] Know then, noble ladies, that 'tis no long time since there dwelt in Romagna a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da Valbona by name, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it happened, there was born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina, [005] a daughter, who, as she grew up, became the fairest and most debonair of all the girls of those parts, and, for that she was the only daughter left to them, was most dearly loved and cherished by her father and mother, who guarded her with most jealous care, thinking to arrange some great match for her. [006] Now there was frequently in Messer Lizio's house, and much in his company, a fine, lusty young man, one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom Messer Lizio and his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as if he had been their own son: who, now and again taking note of the damsel, that she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour most commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with her, which love he was very careful to conceal. [007] The damsel detected it, however, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with him, to Ricciardo's no small satisfaction. [008] Again and again he was on the point of speaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length, however, he summoned up his courage, and seizing his opportunity, thus addressed her: "Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to die for love of thee."[009] Whereto the damsel forthwith responded: "Nay, God grant that it be not rather that I die for love of thee."[010] Greatly exhilarated and encouraged, Ricciardo made answer: "'Twill never be by default of mine that thou lackest aught that may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the means to save thy life and mine."[011] Then said the damsel: "Thou seest, Ricciardo, how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere possible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may do without dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it."[012] Ricciardo was silent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he said: "Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see, to wit, that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have access to the terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew that thou wouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive to meet thee, albeit 'tis very high."[013] "As for my sleeping there," replied Caterina, "I doubt not that it may be managed, if thou art sure that thou canst join me."[014] Ricciardo answered in the affirmative. Whereupon they exchanged a furtive kiss, and parted.
    
    [Voice: filostrato]
    [015] On the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the damsel began complaining to her mother that by reason of the excessive heat she had not been able to get any sleep during the night. [016] "Daughter," said the lady, "what heat was there? Nay, there was no heat at all."[017] "Had you said, 'to my thinking,' mother," rejoined Caterina, "you would perhaps have said sooth; but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have in them than ladies that are advanced in years."[018] "True, my daughter," returned the lady, "but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold, as thou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we find it, and as the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be cooler, and thou wilt sleep better."[019] "God grant it be so," said Caterina, "but 'tis not wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the summer comes on."[020] "What then," said the lady, "wouldst thou have me do?"[021] "With your leave and my father's," answered Caterina, "I should like to have a little bed made up on the terrace by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the nightingales sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much better than in your room."[022] Whereupon: "Daughter, be of good cheer," said the mother; "I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he shall decide."[023] So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between her and the damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason a little morose, said: "What nightingale is this, to whose chant she would fain sleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull her to sleep."[024] Which speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her such offence, that for anger, rather than by reason of the heat, she not only slept not herself that night, but suffered not her mother to sleep, keeping up a perpetual complaint of the great heat. [025] Wherefore her mother hied her in the morning to Messer Lizio, and said to him: "Sir, you hold your daughter none too dear; what difference can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She has tossed about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can you wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale sing? Young folk naturally affect their likes."[026] Whereto Messer Lizio made answer: "Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set a curtain round it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale sing to her heart's content."[027] Which the damsel no sooner learned, than she had a bed made there with intent to sleep there that same night; wherefore she watched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a concerted sign she gave to understand what he was to do. [028] Messer Lizio, as soon as he had heard the damsel go to bed, locked a door that led from his room to the terrace, and went to sleep himself. [029] When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of a ladder got upon a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain toothings of another wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had he fallen, clambered up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him quietly with the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then got them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and joyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few times. [030] But, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards dawn, albeit they wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm encircling Ricciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him by that part of his person which your modesty, my ladies, is most averse to name in the company of men. [031] So, peacefully they slept, and were still asleep when day broke and Messer Lizio rose; and calling to mind that his daughter slept on the terrace, softly opened the door, saying to himself: Let me see what sort of night's rest the nightingale has afforded our Caterina? [032] And having entered, he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and saw Ricciardo asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being quite naked and uncovered; [033] and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went away, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying: "Up, up, wife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale to such purpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand."[034] "How can this be?" said the lady. "[035] Come quickly, and thou shalt see," replied Messer Lizio. [036] So the lady huddled on her clothes, and silently followed Messer Lizio, and when they were come to the bed, and had raised the curtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly enough how her daughter had caught, and did hold the nightingale, whose song she had so longed to hear. [037] Whereat the lady, deeming that Ricciardo had played her a cruel trick, would have cried out and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to her: "Wife, as thou valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth, seeing that she has caught him, he shall be hers. [038] Ricciardo is a gentleman and wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our advantage: if he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry her, so that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage and not in that of another."[039] Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing that her husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had had a good night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale. So she kept silence; [040] nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo awoke; and, seeing that 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much as his life was worth, and aroused Caterina, saying: "Alas! my soul, what shall we do, now that day has come and surprised me here?"[041] Which question Messer Lizio answered by coming forward, and saying: "We shall do well."[042] At sight of him Ricciardo felt as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in the bed, and said: "My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that my disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with me even as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it may be, to spare my life, that I die not."[043] "Ricciardo," replied Messer Lizio, "the love I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited a better return; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into such a transgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by making Caterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for this past night, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way thou mayst secure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy soul to God."[044] Pending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale, and having covered herself, began with many a tear to implore her father to forgive Ricciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio required, that thereby they might securely count upon a long continuance of such nights of delight. [045] But there needed not much supplication; for, what with remorse for the wrong done, and the wish to make amends, and the fear of death, and the desire to escape it, and above all ardent love, and the craving to possess the beloved one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal of his readiness to do as Messer Lizio would have him. [046] Wherefore Messer Lizio, having borrowed a ring from Madonna Giacomina, Ricciardo did there and then in their presence wed Caterina. [047] Which done, Messer Lizio and the lady took their leave, saying: "Now rest ye a while; for so perchance 'twere better for you than if ye rose."[048] And so they left the young folks, who forthwith embraced, and not having travelled more than six miles during the night, went two miles further before they rose, and so concluded their first day. [049] When they were risen, Ricciardo and Messer Lizio discussed the matter with more formality; and some days afterwards Ricciardo, as was meet, married the damsel anew in presence of their friends and kinsfolk, and brought her home with great pomp, and celebrated his nuptials with due dignity and splendour. And so for many a year thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness, and snared the nightingales day and night to his heart's content.

  summary: 
  content: |
    It's hard enough to get Dean onto the plane for a half-hour flight, so Sam is profoundly grateful that his brother is too busy pretending not to panic and humming Metallica to notice that the flight they've checked into is to London, England, not London, Ohio.
    
    When the pilot makes his announcements and Dean <em>does</em> realise just how long he's going to be on the plane, Sam only just escapes receiving an injury to a part of his anatomy they'd both <em>really</em> rather stayed in working order. He waves the tickets under Dean's nose desperately.
    
    '...the hell you think you're - Led Zeppelin...?' Dean's brought up short from his rant.
    
    'Exclusive, one-off reunion concert,' Sam says smugly. 'Chance of a lifetime.'
    
    Dean opens and closes his mouth a few times, helplessly.
    
    'I'll still have to kill you for this,' he says finally. His hand settles heavy and warm on Sam's thigh. 'After the show.'
    
    Sam just keeps grinning.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean doesn't stop grinning the whole way through the show, even when an extremely fat and sweaty guy presses up against him and spills beer down his leather jacket. He's still flying high when the last song's been played and the crowd is spilling out on the street.
    
    'When they played <em>Nobody's Fault</em>, oh dude. I can die happy, now.' Dean's happy glow diminishes for a second when he realises what he's said, because they've had a moratorium on those kind of comments for a while now.
    
    Sam doesn't stop smiling. 'Yeah, about that. You might want to hold off for a while.'
    
    Dean stares at him. 'Sam, if I try to break the deal -'
    
    'If <em>you</em> try to break the deal, yeah.' Sam pulls out a little wooden carving, recognisably Dean except for how it has a big shiny patch smack bang in the middle of its chest. 'You really think I'd bring you all the way to England just to see a bunch of granddads? That guy who spilled his drink on you is the foremost expert in soul magic in the Western hemisphere. He just had to baptise you in the flesh to make the spell stick.'
    
    'Then this...' Dean gestures at the Dean doll. 'You got my soul back?'
    
    Sam just smiles, the kind of smile that says if he tries to say anything he'll end up crying like a girl.
    
    '<em>Dude</em>.'
    
    And maybe Sam could have gone with the crying thing after all, because Dean kisses him right there in the street, big Hollywood smacker, and maybe that even tops seeing Led Zeppelin play live.
