    The bartender smiled as she passed across his drink. "There you go, sugar."
    
    Dean nodded and took his glass over to the table in the corner next to the window. He scanned the bar under guise of taking a long swallow, satisfying himself that no one but the bartender was paying him any real attention. He was pretty sure she wasn't a potential threat, though he'd been wrong before.
    
    He kept a small part of his attention on the door - a lesson learned the hard way three weeks earlier, and the new scar on the back of his neck burned a reminder - but angled his head so that he could look out of the window.
    
    The bar across the street seemed very brightly lit against the darkness outside. It looked classier than the one Dean was in: bigger, airier, more modern music. Bigger windows. It made spying on his brother much easier.
    
    Sam was hanging out on the edge of a larger crowd of other college students. They were laughing and talking, clearly enjoying their Friday night. Sam wasn't laughing, but he was smiling.
    
    Dean took a long drink and glanced around his own bar again before returning his attention to Sam. His brother looked like he was doing okay: if not necessarily happy, then at least content. Looked like he was settling in just fine. Looked like he hadn't given his family a second thought.
    
    Dean downed the rest of his drink and stared at his glass. Having a second sounded downright tempting, but it would blunt his reflexes. It was too risky when he didn't have anyone to watch his back. Then again, he was rapidly reaching the point of not giving a damn.
    
    A quiet <em>beep</em> from his cell phone caught him off-guard, and he snapped his head up to look at his brother again, half-expecting Sam to be looking straight at him, phone in hand, having spotted him at last. But Sam was evidently still oblivious to his presence, grinning at some guy who appeared to be telling him a joke.
    
    Dean flipped open his cell and stared.
    
    <em>1 new message. From Dad.</em>
    
    He clicked the button to read the message, and found himself staring at a set of coordinates.
    
    Dean told himself that what he was feeling was relief. His father was working a pretty long-term undercover job, and Dean hadn't heard anything from him in over a month. The fact that his father felt secure enough now to send a text message had to be a good sign. Maybe the cult was getting less suspicious of him. Maybe he'd be able to get in touch more often now. Maybe he'd come back soon.
    
    Maybe he just hadn't been able to risk anything longer than coordinates. <em>Hey son, hope you're still in one piece</em>, that kind of thing was probably just too risky right now.
    
    Dean slid his cell phone back into his pocket, then stared longingly at his empty glass. He sighed and glanced back out of the window one last time. Sam was now chatting animatedly with a couple of other students, gesturing with one hand as he explained something. Dean swallowed and stood up.
    
    Sam was fine. Dean wasn't needed here.
    
    And he had a job to do.
    
    <hr>
    
    Figuring out where the coordinates pointed to didn't take long, but it was far enough away and the hour was late enough that Dean decided against setting off that night. Instead he plugged his laptop into the phone outlet and searched for local websites about Coeur d'Alene. He got lucky - one of the local newspapers had a website, and Dean scoured it, looking for whatever had attracted his father's attention.
    
    It didn't take him too long. Several people had gone missing in recent months, it seemed, vanished in the woods. The details online were pretty sketchy, though.
    
    "Probably worried about scaring off the tourists," Dean muttered under his breath, and powered down the laptop. The rest could wait until he got there.
    
    For now, he tossed the laptop onto the spare bed - <em>Sam's bed</em>, his traitorous brain persisted in calling it - and checked that his knife, gun and salt were all within easy reach before he climbed into his own bed. He settled down and thought about the distance he had to cover. Sixteen, seventeen hours, easy. The sensible option would probably be to split it across two days.
    
    But for his father to have contacted him... it had to be urgent. And even if it wasn't... well, it wasn't exactly like Dean had any reason to hang around here.
    
    He closed his eyes and waited for sleep to take him.
    
    <hr>
    
    It was late evening and Dean was exhausted by the time he arrived in Coeur d'Alene. He found a motel room first thing, and didn't bother going any further than the vending machine for something to eat. By the time he settled down in a nearby diner the next morning, armed with copies of the local newspapers and a stack of pancakes brought by a waitress with a tired but genuine smile, he was feeling much better.
    
    The newspapers here had far more information than he'd been able to find online. There was a front-page article about the most recent disappearances; it seemed four people from the surrounding area had vanished in the last month alone. The more in-depth feature a few pages further in had several other details Dean found interesting. Another three people had been found dead during the past month in the woods near Fernan Lake. There was no obvious connection, apparently, except the lack of any clear cause of death in each of the three cases. The medical examiner had ruled them to be heart failure.
    
    "Refill?" the waitress offered, appearing at his booth again.
    
    "That'd be great... Peggy," Dean said, reading her name-tag and shooting her a grin. "Say, don't suppose you could join me for a few minutes, tell me a bit about this place? I just got into town."
    
    Peggy cast an uncertain glance at the counter, but weakened under his smile and slipped into the booth opposite him. "Well, we're not too busy yet, I guess I could take a break for a few minutes. You here on vacation?"
    
    "Something like that," Dean said, wrapping his hands around his coffee cup. "Thought I might do some hiking out in the woods near one of the lakes. I, uh - trees, you know, they're awesome."
    
    "Hiking isn't so much my thing, I'll be honest with you," Peggy said. "But there sure are some beautiful lakes near here. Lake Coeur d'Alene, of course, and Fernan Lake. Then there's Hayden Lake, up to the north - plenty more up that way."
    
    "I was thinking of heading out to Fernan Lake, actually," Dean said. "But then I read this article in the paper, and it sounds like it might be kind of a dangerous area to go hiking. People dying, people going missing..."
    
    "Oh lord, yes," Peggy said. "It's so strange. I mean, well, accidents do happen, and sometimes tourists can get lost in the woods and run into problems, but these were local folks, lived here for years. And - oh, I don't know."
    
    "What?" Dean prompted.
    
    "Well, they're saying the people who died all had heart attacks," Peggy said. "But one of them was a college student - she was only twenty-one. And with three deaths in a month... people talk. There've been rumors about those woods for years." She flushed and looked down at the table. "Silly local superstitions, you might say."
    
    "I don't know about that," Dean said, trying to keep his interest subtle. "Seems to me there's always some reason for local superstitions. What are the rumors about?"
    
    "People say they see lights out there, sometimes," Peggy admitted. "They say there're places in the woods where compasses don't work properly, just lead you off in the wrong direction or spin round and round. Every so often someone'll come out of the woods and not remember a thing that happened since they went in."
    
    "Wow," Dean said. "Anything like that ever happen to you?"
    
    "Like I say, hiking isn't my thing," Peggy said with a smile. "I stay out of the woods." Her smile faded slightly. "But my brother-in-law, he went hiking out there once, not long after he moved here. He was gone a whole weekend, my sister was near out of her mind with worry. When he came back... he couldn't remember a thing. Doctors said he must have hit his head: they called it amnesia, said that was why he was so confused, but there wasn't a mark on him. He won't set foot in those woods these days."
    
    "It really does sound like a dangerous place to go hiking," Dean said slowly.
    
    "People dying is new," Peggy said. "We never had that before - oh, a couple of deaths, maybe, years and years back, but nothing like this. People getting lost, getting confused, sure, but not dying. It never seemed all that serious until now." She lowered her voice, leaning forward. "There's some that say the government's up to something out there - experiments or something - and that's what's causing it all." She straightened again, glancing over at the counter, where a customer was now waiting to be served. "At any rate, you might be better off sticking to the woods near one of the other lakes. And now I'd better be getting back to work." She slid back out of the booth.
    
    "Thanks, Peggy, I appreciate your help," Dean said warmly.
    
    He sipped his coffee and read through the articles again, more slowly this time. Lights in the woods sounded like will-o'-the-wisps, maybe; that might also explain the confusion Peggy had referred to. But something about that theory just didn't sit right. 
    
    He left Peggy a large tip and headed out to find the local library.
    
    <hr>
    
    The library turned out to be well-stocked with newspaper archives and Dean spent the morning ploughing through them. He didn't much enjoy this part of the job without Sam or Dad. They both <em>liked</em> research, could happily spend hours on it. Having to do it all himself - he was capable enough, but hell, Dean considered himself a man of action. And short of luring the cute reference librarian into a dark corner of the stacks, Dean didn't think he was going to find much action here.
    
    Dull or not, by the time lunchtime rolled around, Dean was feeling fairly satisfied with the information he'd found. He'd learned that, in addition to the college student, the other two people to die in the woods recently had been a thirty-year-old jogger and a local businessman. There was no obvious connection between them, except for the way they'd died. He'd also been interested to learn that the college student's boyfriend was one of the missing people. They'd been out in the woods together.
    
    His research had also confirmed most of what Peggy had told him. There were several articles dealing with the strange rumors about the woods near Fernan Lake - strange flashes of light, compasses not working properly. He'd dismissed the government conspiracy theory immediately: people tended to find it easier to believe in that kind of thing than in the supernatural - too much time spent watching The X-Files, maybe. But the more he'd read, the more he'd come to the conclusion that whatever was going on didn't sound like will-o'-the-wisps. The descriptions given by people in interviews weren't like those he'd seen on other jobs.
    
    He'd even managed to track down the deaths from 'years and years back' that Peggy had referred to in passing. A few people had died in the woods over the years, but in most cases there had been a clear cause of death. Back in 1979, though, there had been five mysterious deaths - two of them, like the current cases, with no obvious cause of death. The other three bodies had been badly mutilated, with fevered speculation in the local newspaper about whether a dangerous animal was on the prowl in the woods, or whether there might be a more human predator out there. No explanation had ever been found, but after that spate of deaths, the woods had been quiet again.
    
    Until now.
    
    Dean shot one last appreciative grin at the reference librarian and gathered up his research.
    
    If his dad had been there, he'd have insisted on tracking down the families of some of the victims and trying to get more information from them. If Sam had been there, he'd have insisted they needed more of an idea about what they were dealing with before they went plunging into anything.
    
    But Dean was alone. And as far as he was concerned, it was time to go to the source.
    
    <hr>
    
    He left the car parked off the side of the road, far enough out of town that no one was likely to come across it. He double-checked his pockets - cell phone, compass, map, gun, salt, holy water, drinking water, M&amp;Ms... all the essentials - and set off into the woods.
    
    He'd researched the exact locations where the bodies had been found and now he headed in that direction, keeping a sharp eye on his compass as well as the woods around him.
    
    What he'd told Peggy about liking trees had been bullshit, of course. Dean preferred towns, for the simple reason that they tended to offer more in the way of coffee and alcohol and cute reference librarians with dark hair and bright eyes. But there <em>were </em>things he liked about being outside of civilization, like the way the fake veneer of normality fell away. People spent their lives turning on the lights to keep from being afraid of the dark, and Dean always took a savage sort of satisfaction in the way that all disappeared out in the woods. It might not be safe, but at least it was honest, and Dean would take facing up to the reality of the way the world was ahead of running off to college and pretending to be normal any day.
    
    "Not naming any names, of course, <em>Sam</em>," he muttered under his breath, taking an obscure comfort in the childishness of it, as if Sam were there to bitch at him for being a jerk.
    
    It was only mid-afternoon and the woods weren't as dark as he'd expected, sunlight filtering down among the leaves and tinting the world green. Dean hummed Blue Oyster Cult songs as he walked along, trying not to wish that Sam or his dad were there to talk to. Trees were goddamn boring.
    
    He'd been walking for just over an hour when the compass needle suddenly spun through three hundred and sixty degrees. Dean stopped and stared at it, then looked around warily. Trees and more trees: there didn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary about this spot. He eyed the compass again. The needle had stopped spinning now, but it was pointing in a completely different direction than it had before.
    
    "Well, shit," Dean muttered, and stowed the compass back in his pocket, figuring it was more likely to be a hindrance than help in finding his way at this stage. It was just as well he'd found out about that phenomenon before heading out. He imagined someone not watching their compass so intently and being led in completely the wrong direction. The number of people who'd gotten lost out in these woods no longer seemed so surprising.
    
    The weird deaths, though, and the lights. It didn't explain that. Or why the compass was acting screwy in the first place.
    
    Dean continued in the direction it had been pointing before it began spinning. He wasn't planning on going too far, not when he couldn't count on finding his way back, and especially not when it was likely to start getting dark soon, but he wasn't ready to give up quite yet.
    
    Ten minutes later, he stopped again and stared around. He figured it would probably be a bad idea to keep going at this point: there was still no sign of anything weird, apart from the compass, and he thought he'd be better off coming back out again the next morning - this time maybe with a ball of twine, like some kid going into a labyrinth, so he could find his way back.
    
    He was turning to head back, orienting himself carefully, when he saw the lights.
    
    They were over to his left, only partially visible through the trees: brilliant flashes of red and blue and a sickly shade of green. Dean stared at them. Okay, definitely not will-o'-the-wisps. The way these lights <em>moved</em>... He chewed on his lip, thinking. On the one hand, he really wanted to get a closer look at them and try to figure out what they were. On the other hand, there was a damn good chance that something was trying to lure him off course and get him hopelessly lost.
    
    Then someone started screaming.
    
    Dean swore and started running in the direction of the lights, gun in hand. The screaming didn't stop. It might be a trap, but Dean couldn't take the risk, not if someone really might be enduring that much pain.
    
    It had cut out by the time he drew closer, close enough to see the dark figures who were shooting the jets of light at each other. For a moment, Dean wondered if they were shades of some kind, before one of them turned and he got a clearer view.
    
    They were human.
    
    Dean dropped to the ground, staying behind cover as best he could while trying to get a good enough view to figure out what was going on. He peered from behind a bush, parting the leaves to see better.
    
    They were definitely human, dressed in weird black robes and wearing creepy-ass masks that hid their faces. The robes reminded Dean horribly of the necromancer he'd run into three weeks earlier, but he forced himself to stay calm and recognize the differences. Necromancers didn't go in for masks like that, and they weren't exactly the kind to work together, either.
    
    Because now that he was closer, it was clear that these figures weren't attacking each other - they were working together to attack something or someone else out of Dean's view. The jets of light were coming from something in their hands, like short st-
    
    Like... <em>wands</em>.
    
    <em>Oh, you gotta be kidding me. What the hell?</em>
    
    Dean kept low against the ground but crept forward, trying to get a better look at what was going on and what the jets of light coming from the 'wands' - he had to be wrong, he couldn't even <em>think </em>the word with a straight face - were being aimed at. It was hard to stay out of sight with the masked figures moving around, but he didn't want to go charging in without a better idea of what they were doing. Especially considering the screaming he'd heard before. Then again, the screaming was the reason he had to see what was happening.
    
    His breath caught as he finally spotted the target: there were two girls on the other side of the clearing, his age or slightly younger, also wearing dark robes but unmasked. One was lying sprawled on the forest floor, unconscious or dead, her red hair stained darker with the blood that was slipping across her face. The other was crouching over her, wild blonde hair hiding her face as she fumbled with something around the other girl's neck.
    
    One of the masked figures yelled something that sounded like Latin, and a jet of purple light shot from its wand and hit the blonde girl. She cried out as it knocked her backwards, away from her friend, and Dean could see blood dripping from a deep cut in one of her arms.
    
    That was enough for Dean. He had a pretty good idea now who was responsible for the deaths and disappearances in these woods, and he wasn't about to stand back and let them kill another two people.
    
    He brought his gun up, but before he could shoot, one of the dark figures yelled something that sounded freakily like 'Abracadabra' and sent sickly green light shooting towards the unmoving red-haired girl.
    
    The blonde had ripped something from around her own neck, however - a chain or a necklace, maybe, from the glimpse Dean got - and she threw it at her friend, a moment faster. Her aim was good: it landed on the other girl's chest.
    
    And the red-head vanished, the green light smashing into the ground where she'd been lying instead.
    
    <em>Holy fuck</em>.
    
    The blonde had managed to get to her knees now, and Dean saw that she was holding a wand of her own in her uninjured hand. He hesitated. If she was one of them too, should he really intervene?
    
    She made a swift, complicated gesture with her wand, her lips shaping something Dean couldn't hear, and silver light flooded from her wand, engulfing one of the masked figures, who shrieked and vanished. The three remaining figures snarled and raised their own wands, and Dean saw the girl take a deep breath, lifting her head with a dignified calm that surprised him. Her eyes seemed very large in her pale face.
    
    <em>She's a witch or something</em>, Dean told himself.<em> For all you know, she's as bad as the rest of them. For all you know, she deserves it. Stay out of it.</em>
    
    That calm expression, though...
    
    <em>Fuck this</em>.
    
    His first shot took one of the masked figures through the shoulder, knocking them to the ground, and he caught sight of the girl rolling clear of another flash of green light and then pushing herself up, staring in his direction. He didn't let himself get distracted, however - he shot the second masked figure in the arm. It was fucking annoying that they were human, because shots like that were stupid. Dean knew how good he was with a gun, but he also knew how risky it was, shooting to <em>not </em>kill. Humans were an all-around pain in the ass when it came to hunting. Give him a poltergeist any day of the week.
    
    The third figure disappeared with a panicked cry as he turned his gun on it, before he could even shoot, and Dean blinked, staring at the empty space where it had been standing. He recognized his mistake immediately, seeing the second figure he'd taken out raising its wand again out of the corner of his eye, but he was turning too slowly to shoot it first -
    
    A wave of red light struck the masked figure and it collapsed, the wand slipping out of its fingers and rolling across the forest floor. Dean snapped his head round and stared at the girl, who had turned her attention to the remaining masked figure, slumped on the ground. She raised her wand, opening her mouth, but the figure disappeared before she could say anything.
    
    Dean stared around for a moment, and then pointed his gun at the girl.
    
    She was watching him now, her wand aimed at him, and ridiculous though it was to feel threatened by a piece of wood, Dean had seen what she could do with it and he <em>really</em> didn't like it. She might have saved his life by taking out the masked figure that had been about to attack him, but that didn't mean much.
    
    The girl frowned at him slightly, as if he'd said something that had confused her, and lowered her wand. "Are you Martin?"
    
    Dean stared at her, not lowering his gun yet. Her accent was weird... British, maybe? "What?"
    
    "Martin," the girl said patiently, as if they were having the conversation over coffee in a diner. "Are you Martin Miggs?"
    
    "...No," Dean said, and finally lowered his gun. She seemed far too calm to be about to try to kill him. "Is that who you were looking for? Who are you?"
    
    "Oh no, I wasn't looking for Martin," the girl said serenely. "I just thought, with the gun, you might be him. It's still nice to meet you, though." She frowned down at her injured arm as if wondering what had happened to it.
    
    "Who are you?" Dean demanded again, trying not to get side-tracked. He started walking cautiously across the clearing towards her. "What are you doing out here? What the hell's going on?"
    
    The girl looked up at him again, unblinking. "I'm Luna. Luna Lovegood. And I think... I think a Wrackspurt may have caught me."
    
    Before Dean could even try to make any sense out of that, her eyes rolled back and she collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
    
    <hr>
    
    The cut on her arm looked nasty, particularly since he didn't have a first-aid kit with him. He wasn't sure whether it was what had made her pass out or not, though. It was bleeding pretty heavily, but hardly 'spurting'. Assuming that was even what she'd been talking about.
    
    Then again, people said some pretty weird things when they were on the verge of passing out. Sam had once sworn blind, past the point of all reason, that Dean had dyed his hair blond while they'd been separated - for five minutes, and in a haunted house without working plumbing, so when and where Dean was meant to have done it only Sam knew - and Dean had been on the point of demanding to know whether his brother needed his eyes tested when Sam had taken a swandive, which had at least cleared up that mystery. So maybe the girl had just been talking nonsense.
    
    He ripped off the tattered sleeve of her robe and used it to bandage the wound, the best he could do until they got back to the Impala. Assuming they made it back. Dean no longer knew which direction he'd come running from when he'd seen the lights, and he couldn't trust his compass. On the other hand, he didn't want to just hang around when there was a chance the masked figures might come back. And the one still lying there wasn't dead and might wake up from whatever the girl had done to him at any moment.
    
    He swore and levered the girl to her feet, then gave up and hauled her up into his arms. Hopefully she would wake up soon, because he didn't think he could carry her the whole way back to the car, even if he did somehow manage to find the way. He hesitated, then tentatively reached down for her wand, bracing himself, half-expecting it to give him an electric shock. But he felt nothing when he touched it. Oddly, that seemed even less reassuring. He slid it into his pocket anyway, readjusted his grip on the girl, and set off, judging the direction as best he could.
    
    By the time she sighed a little and opened her eyes ten minutes later, Dean had long since reached the conclusion that he was hopelessly lost, and it was a relief to have a distraction. He lowered her to the ground and fished out his bottle of drinking water.
    
    "Hey. You awake?"
    
    She looked at him with a vagueness that made him worry she might be worse injured than he'd thought. "Oh. Martin."
    
    "Not Martin," Dean said. "Dean. Here, have some water."
    
    She took a sip and blinked at him. "You don't look like Dean. Do you draw, too?"
    
    "...No," Dean said. "I'm - another Dean, I guess."
    
    "Oh. What do you do, then?" the girl asked conversationally.
    
    <em>Man, shouldn't she be making more sense now she's awake?</em> "I - I hunt. Look, who are you?"
    
    "I told you, I'm Luna," she said. "You got rid of the Wrackspurt, didn't you? Thank you, Dean."
    
    Deciding that debating that issue was only going to derail the conversation further, Dean said, "You're welcome. So what are you, Luna? A witch, or something?"
    
    "Yes, I'm a witch," Luna said. She was watching him with an uncomfortably direct gaze now. "And you're a Muggle, aren't you? I wasn't very good at Muggle Studies, I'm afraid."
    
    <em>God, I hate witches. Though since when do witches really wave goddamn <strong>wands </strong>about?</em> His train of thought was interrupted again, though. "Muggle?"
    
    "A non-wizard," Luna said. "Is there a reason we're sitting in the middle of the woods? I'm sure they're nice woods, but the Death Eaters will probably come back."
    
    <em>Death Eaters?</em> "I - we're lost. My compass won't show the right way out here -" Dean paused. "Which, I'm guessing, is down to something you lot have done, yeah? Any chance you could sort that out, sweetheart? Because we could be sitting out in these woods for a good long while, otherwise."
    
    He took satisfaction in seeing <em>Luna </em>blink in confusion for once. "There..." She hesitated, frowning, before suddenly nodding as if she'd figured something out. "There's a house near here - hidden from Muggles. There are protections against Muggle devices. Do you have my wand?"
    
    Dean eyed her. "In my pocket. But why should I give it to you?"
    
    "People have been known to lose body parts, carrying wands in their pockets," Luna said dreamily. "Sometimes quite important body parts."
    
    Dean pulled out the wand hastily. Luna smiled at him, and he honestly couldn't tell whether she was laughing at him or not.
    
    "I can find the way, if you give it to me," she said. "Or we could sit here a while longer. These really are nice woods." She looked around with apparently genuine interest.
    
    Dean shook his head and passed her the wand. They were going to wander around forever if they couldn't find a way out, and he didn't think he'd be able to handle her weird style of conversation for that long.
    
    Luna balanced the wand carefully on her palm and whispered, "<em>Point me</em>."
    
    Dean watched skeptically, then felt his mouth drop open as the wand spun of its own accord to point in a different direction. He shut his mouth again immediately - it was stupid, after the fight he'd just seen, to be weirded out by sight of something as minor as that, but there was something creepier about it than the jets of light they'd all been shooting around the place.
    
    "That's north," Luna said brightly. "Which way do we have to go?"
    
    <hr>
    
    It took more than two hours in the dark to reach the Impala, and by the time they got there Luna was almost out again, stumbling along. Dean had been forced to wrap his arm around her to support her, against his better judgment. It saved on time wasted when she stopped to apologize to the trees she bumped into, though.
    
    Yeah, Dean wasn't even going to think about that one.
    
    He opened the back door of the car and lowered her onto the bench seat, returning a few moments later with the first-aid kit. He unwrapped the robe from around her arm and examined the wound. It could probably use a few stitches, but it could wait until - 
    
    ...Was he seriously planning to take her back to the motel to patch her up? Dean bit his lip and stared at the girl slumped in the back seat. Disturbing though the idea was, he could only imagine the havoc Luna would manage to cause at a hospital. He might be able to explain away her strange clothes and accent, but not so much her... general weirdness. Besides, he still didn't really know what was going on in the woods. From what she'd said, those masked figures might come back any time, and he still didn't know who they were or what they wanted.
    
    <em>...Son of a bitch</em>.
    
    Dean pushed the girl properly into the car and closed the door, then climbed in the front. It was going to be a long night.
    
    <hr>
    
    Cleaning the wound took him a while: traipsing through the woods hadn't done it any good, despite his makeshift bandage.
    
    "Shouldn't it be healing by now?"
    
    Dean looked up, startled; he hadn't realized she was conscious. Luna was watching him with mild interest.
    
    "I'm just cleaning it," Dean said, clearing his throat. "I think it may need stitches."
    
    "I've seen stitches before," Luna said gravely. "But I still have my wand. I'm sure I'll be strong enough to heal it in the morning."
    
    Dean stared at her. "What, just like that? A wave of the wand, and that's it?"
    
    "Normally we use potions," Luna said. "But there's a lot you can do with a wand. Of course, you can only heal yourself up to a certain point. Then you're in too much pain to concentrate properly, and it can get a bit counterproductive. But once I've had some sleep I'm sure I'll manage."
    
    Dean gave up. Potions? Wands? Magical healing? He wasn't going to deal with any of that shit tonight. "Fine, whatever." He slapped a clean bandage on her arm; let her worry about it in the morning with her hocus pocus.
    
    "Is this your home?" Luna asked, glancing around.
    
    "No," Dean said. "It's a motel." At her frown, he added, "Like... a place where you rent a room."
    
    "Oh, I see," Luna said, her frown evaporating. "We have them too, we just don't call them that. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
    
    Dean looked at her arm. "You can stay." He looked up sharply at her face. "You can stay because I've got a lot of questions I want answered, sweetheart. And in the morning you're going to answer them. Got that?"
    
    "Yes," Luna agreed calmly. "Thank you." She reached down and began to maneuver the weird black robe she was wearing carefully over her arm and head. Dean shut his mouth with a snap and turned away quickly, caught off-guard. Then glanced over his shoulder, sneaking a peek at pale skin marred by an occasional bruise and a long, thin scar down her back. He made himself look away again.
    
    Once she was safely - albeit nakedly, <em>Jesus</em>, though he should have been expecting it, since she hadn't exactly had a suitcase of clothes with her - beneath the covers, Dean snapped off the lights and quickly stripped down to his shorts, feeling oddly exposed even though there was no way Luna could see anything. He wasn't really planning to sleep, not with some crazy chick in the room with him and no one there to watch his back, but if he pretended, he stood a better chance of avoiding any more weird conversations with her.
    
    "Don't go trying any hocus pocus on me in the middle of the night," he warned her gruffly, sliding into his own bed.
    
    "I won't," she said seriously.
    
    It shouldn't have reassured him, but it did. Dean lay there and listened to her breathing as it smoothed out. It was weird, having someone sleeping in the same room as him again. He'd picked up a few chicks since... well, since, but he'd taken very few of them back to his room, and none had stayed the night.
    
    Would it be so bad if he closed his eyes? She'd saved his life back in those woods, probably, even if he had returned the favour. If she'd been going to abracadabra him, she could have done it back there.
    
    Anyway. Even if she did, would it really matter?
    
    <hr>
    
    It was the whisper that woke him the next morning - words that his half-asleep mind didn't understand, but he knew there shouldn't be <em>any</em> words being whispered in his motel room. He jolted to a sitting position, knife already in his hand.
    
    The girl was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the other bed, holding her wand against the arm that had been injured. Even as Dean watched, though, she lowered the wand again, her arm unmarked as if nothing had ever happened. She looked up at Dean and smiled.
    
    "Good morning. That's an interesting knife."
    
    Dean reluctantly stuck it back under his pillow. Luna smiled wider and tucked her wand behind her ear. Dean narrowed his eyes - it wasn't coincidence that she'd put her weapon away as soon as he had his. He was quickly coming to the conclusion that, weird or not, this girl wasn't half as oblivious to what was going on around her as she seemed.
    
    "How's your arm?" he asked, after an awkward moment's silence.
    
    "Oh, it's fine now, thanks," Luna said, glancing down at it.
    
    "Useful trick," Dean observed, thinking back to a dozen times when he or his father had been injured and he would have killed for that ability.
    
    "I'm no Healer," Luna confessed. "All I really know is basic first-aid and few tricks I've picked up. But it's a handy skill to have, especially these days."
    
    "About that," Dean started, then stopped. There was no way he could handle all of this without something to eat. "On second thought, you hungry?"
    
    "A bit, yes," she said. "We didn't have much chance to eat, the last few days."
    
    "Okay." Dean eyed her. "Can I trust you to stay here and not cause any trouble while I grab a shower? And then we can go find somewhere to eat, and you can fill me in on what the hell is going on here."
    
    Luna smiled again. "I'll be good."
    
    Well, she hadn't killed him in his sleep, so it was probably safe enough. Dean slid out of bed and headed for the bathroom, only to stutter to a halt halfway there, suddenly realizing - at the feeling of her eyes on him - that he was only wearing his shorts. He hastily grabbed a change of clothes from his bag and shut the bathroom door behind him, all without looking back.

    There's no distance in Hell. 
    
    Bela figures out fast that the place isn't keen on constants of any kind. Even the pain isn't constant - oh, it's always there, but sometimes it eases up a little, probably to make sure she <em>really</em> feels it when it gets worse again. But nothing in Hell is static. There are a few landmarks she comes to recognize, sometimes close by, sometimes out of sight - a jagged spike of rock, a dark hole, a river of blood. She's can't tell how much of her shifting surroundings is real and how much is just in her mind.
    
    There's no time in Hell, either. She can only measure its passing in pain and screaming, so all she knows is that she's been there long enough to have learned to think through the lowest levels of torment when she first sees Dean Winchester.
    
    She blinks blood out of her eyes and looks at him. He's newly arrived, she can tell that much - still screaming his brother's name, begging Sam to come and save him. He'll give up on that soon enough, she knows. There's no hope in Hell.
    
    She doesn't think he sees her, and she's too hoarse from screaming to call out to him. Besides, she remembers what it was like when she first arrived in Hell. It'll be a while before he's aware of anything but the torment.
    
    The hook carving into her chest blazes white-hot, and she loses sight of him, swallowed up again by her own pain.
    
    <hr>
    
    "Dean."
    
    She doesn't know how long it's been. Long enough that his t-shirt is gone, rotted or ripped away, or maybe just abandoned by whatever part of his subconscious conjured it up. Long enough that when he raises his head at the sound of his name there's no hope left in the movement, just a weariness she knows only too well.
    
    It takes a moment for him to recognize her, and she tells herself it's because he's in pain, not because she's unrecognizable with the hook driven into her cheek.
    
    "Bela?"
    
    "In the flesh," she says. "So to speak."
    
    The corner of his mouth quirks up at that, and she feels a flash of <em>something </em>she can't put a name to, because Hell hasn't beaten him down completely yet. And if she can come that close to making him smile, then she's not as far gone as she thought after all.
    
    It's worth it, even when her chains tighten and tug her away sickeningly in the next moment, spinning her away from him before either of them can say anything else.
    
    <hr>
    
    "This isn't exactly how I pictured it," Dean says, the next time they find themselves near each other and they're both lucid at the same time.
    
    "You were expecting flames too, were you?" Bela asks drily.
    
    "And pitchforks," Dean says. "I feel cheated."
    
    "Don't give them any ideas," Bela says, and feels the humor slip away from her. It's hard to hold on to anything positive here for long, and she's thinking more of that than the chains when she murmurs, "Flames or not, this place is bad enough."
    
    "We'll get out," Dean tells her, and the statement is ridiculous enough to make her jerk her head round to look at him, ignoring the pain it causes as the hooks tear into her.
    
    "You've got to be joking."
    
    "Sam'll find a way," Dean says. "And hey, I'll let you tag along too. Even though you stole my car that one time."
    
    Bela knows there's no chance. She spent ten years searching, and if there was a way, she'd have found it. But she doesn't argue with him. The thin veneer of bravado feels like defiance, feels like a triumph in its own right, and that counts for something.
    
    <hr>
    
    There's no respite in Hell. She'd had ten years to imagine what the Pit would be like, and she'd always assumed that she would probably pass out from the pain at times, even though sleep wouldn't be an option. She'd wondered if she would go mad, and how long it would take, and whether it would seem like a blessing by then. But there's no refuge, not in sleep and not in insanity: awareness is a curse she can't escape, even when the agony is too overwhelming for her to be able to take in her surroundings. 
    
    The times when the pain eases up come as a relief, but they're hard in a different way. She's always bracing herself for the torment resuming, and though the waiting isn't worse - not even close - it's not exactly fun. Mostly she spends the wait counting - counting demons, the damned souls around her, the links in her chains.
    
    The demons don't bother with the damned much, but they make an exception for Dean. She can see them in the distance, crowding round him. Dean's responsible for sending a good number of demons back down here, she knows. A lot of them want to pay him a visit now that he's here too.
    
    She can pick out the pitch of his screaming among the cries of the other damned souls, even from this far away.
    
    <hr>
    
    "Cracking this easily?" she asks.
    
    Her voice is a shadow of what it used to be, but she manages to inject just enough contempt into her tone to achieve the desired effect. Dean blinks and turns his head slowly in her direction. He doesn't say anything, though, and she doesn't think it's just because he's still trying to catch his breath.
    
    She supposes this is why Hell lets them see each other from time to time: so they can watch each other slipping and changing, see each other being defeated.
    
    "Thought you were more of a man than that, Dean," she says.
    
    "Go to hell," he whispers, his voice cracked. It's still the sweetest sound she's heard in a while.
    
    <hr>
    
    "I always wondered if you'd scream in the sack."
    
    Bela forces her eyes open. Dean looks - well, knowing that it's not really his body doesn't make it any easier to see the way the skin has been flayed away right across his shoulder, exposing raw flesh around the hook. She can still remember, just about, the way he looked in a tux, the games she'd wanted to play then. Now -
    
    - well, it's not like she looks her best right now either.
    
    "Don't think <em>you </em>could have made me scream," she chokes out.
    
    It's comforting that he can still manage to be completely inappropriate, even in Hell. Bela tries to hold on to that, but she's screaming again before she can hear his reply.
    
    <hr>
    
    He stops screaming Sam's name, after a while. Now he just screams. Bela's already seen a hundred damned souls go through the same process: it happens to them all.
    
    "Eternity," she says at some point. "I never really understood what the word meant until now."
    
    "Not going to be here for eternity," Dean says.
    
    Bela sighs. It's been a while since he's said anything like that, promised her that Sam will find a way to get him out, that he won't leave her here, that he'll come back for her. She'd thought Hell had finally managed to snuff out the spark of faith in his brother that Dean kept holding on to. She can't figure out if she's irritated or reassured that it hasn't. "If you say so."
    
    "I guess they let us out of the chains when we turn into demons," Dean says, and she belatedly realizes there was no hope in his voice. "Or maybe the power to bust out of them comes as a package deal with the black eyes."
    
    Bela looks at him. "You mean -?"
    
    "This is how demons are made," Dean tells her. "That's what we're going to become, sooner or later." It's not just an absence of hope in his voice now: it's despair.
    
    Bela thinks about it, and wonders whether she'd prefer it to happen sooner or later.
    
    <hr>
    
    There's no light in Hell.
    
    Despite that, she can see, at least most of the time. There are shades of darkness, flashes of red and grey. And she supposes that since she's not really seeing with her eyes, she doesn't need light to make out what's around her anyway.
    
    When the white light appears in the distance, far above, Bela cries out, and hears every damned soul do the same.
    
    It's almost like a star, shining so brightly that she thinks she would be blinded if it was really her eyes she was seeing it with. It's falling into the darkness with such slow, elegant grace that Bela knows that in reality it's moving incredibly fast, just across an immense distance.
    
    The demons are crying out now too, fear and rage in their voices.
    
    Bela's chains snap taut, pulling her as far away as possible, and she can see the other damned souls being dragged with her, all of them pressed closer than ever before. Hell is rearranging itself, recoiling as if it fears the light.
    
    But the light moves faster, and she realizes it's heading straight for the damned souls. There's no hope in Hell, but Bela holds her breath anyway.
    
    Instead of coming to her, the light plunges down nearby, reaching out, and Bela hears a cry of shocked pain.
    
    She would know Dean Winchester's voice anywhere.
    
    Then the light is rising again. All around her the damned souls are wailing, begging; the demons are screaming, though none of them seem to dare to attack the light. Bela watches in silence. The light is too bright for her to make out more than the faint outline of Dean clutched inside it, and a hint of something that might be wings.
    
    Then it's gone, and Hell seems even darker than before. Bela stares at the point where the light disappeared, and thinks of how Dean used to promise her they'd escape.
    
    There's no hope in Hell, but she thinks knowing that Dean Winchester is back on earth might be the next best thing.

    'Tell me.' Jensen's voice is harsh, inflexible as the hold he's got on Jared's wrists. He squeezes Jared's cock with his other hand, jerks him once, agonisingly slowly, tightening his fist again when Jared tries to buck up into his grip.
    
    'Tell me what you were doing,' he says again. He leans in close and sucks at Jared's neck, teeth scraping just right along the thin skin over Jared's pulse.
    
    'Trying - trying to make you jealous.' Jared's already close to losing it, gasping as Jensen jerks his cock again, thumb slipping up to rub across the head. 'Pay me some - oh - some attention, 'stead of talking with Chris all night.'
    
    'Pay you some attention?' Jensen gives him a long look, green eyes considering, weighing Jared up. 'Okay.'
    
    Abruptly, Jensen releases his grip on Jared. He trails his hand along Jared's side and up, teasing at a nipple till Jared cries out and surges up towards him.
    
    'Nuh-uh.' The easy tone belies the speed and strength with which Jensen catches at his wrists, bears Jared back down onto the bed.
    'You wanted my attention. Now you're gonna lie right there, like a good boy, while I give it to you.'
    
    Jensen keeps his hand resting heavy there a long moment, eyes locked on Jared's until Jared gives a little shiver and stops resisting, all the fight gone out of him.
    
    An hour later, Jensen pushes into him, <em>hot steady burn</em> against skin already licked and sucked oversensitive, and Jared feels himself shaking apart.
    
    He likes it when Jensen pays attention.

    The diner was almost deserted, much to Dean's relief: Luna was taking everything in with an undisguised curiosity that was bound to attract attention. And that wasn't even taking into account what she was wearing. Dean had finally made her put his leather jacket on over her robes, in the hope of passing them off as a dress or something. With that and the wand - now stuck in her hair, which she'd put up in some weird knot - Dean was just relieved that there weren't more people around to stare at them.
    
    "So," Dean said, to take his mind off the way she looked with his jacket almost swallowing her up. "You owe me a lot of answers, sweetheart."
    
    Luna nodded and took a sip of orange juice. "I suppose so. Where do you want me to start?"
    
    "How about you tell me what you were doing out in those woods, and who the guys in black were?" Dean suggested.
    
    "They were Death Eaters," Luna said.
    
    Dean raised his eyebrows expectantly. "I'm guessing you don't mean cannibals."
    
    Luna looked thoughtful. "Not that I'm aware of. Although with some of them it might explain a thing or two. No, the Death Eaters are the followers of the Dark Lord..."
    
    The explanation was long and complicated, even without taking into account Luna's habit of going off on strange tangents. Finally Dean held up a hand to stop her. "Okay, hold up. Let me see if I've got this straight. So there's, like, a whole wizarding world out there and right now it's at war because some asshole with a thing for melodramatic titles wants to take over?"
    
    "I can't tell you his name," Luna said. "They put a curse on it, so they would know every time someone said it. Though it wasn't his real name anyway. It seems silly to go to all the trouble of changing your name if you're not going to let anyone use the new one afterwards. He could have just stuck with his real name. But the Dark Lord can be a bit stupid sometimes."
    
    "...Right," Dean said. "So this 'Dark Lord' decides it would be great if nobody could kill him, and basically chops up bits of his <em>soul</em>?" It sounded weird, but Dean had seen too many fucked-up things over the years to disbelieve her because of that alone.
    
    "They get stored in objects," Luna said gravely. "He can't be killed unless we find and destroy all of them. Some of them we've already dealt with - an old diary and a ring. Some of them haven't been found, but we know what they are, or think we do. Harry -"
    
    "That's your friend, the kid you said he didn't manage to kill," Dean interrupted, double-checking he was still following her wandering explanation.
    
    "Yes, that's right," Luna said. "Harry Potter. Harry can't leave the country at the moment - he and his friends have been in hiding for almost five years now, trying to avoid being captured and to find the other Horcruxes. He's the only one who can kill the Dark Lord. So we came to -"
    
    "Whoa, hold it," Dean interrupted again, his attention still caught by what she'd just said. "They're trying to find <em>what</em>?"
    
    "The Horcruxes," Luna repeated. "That's what the objects bound to the bits of soul are called."
    
    Dean stared at her. "A <em>whore-crux</em>? You've gotta be kidding me."
    
    Luna blinked at him serenely, just the faintest upturn at the corner of her mouth to hint that she might understand his reaction. "Harry and his friends have found and destroyed a few of them already," she went on. "But there are a few we haven't found yet. We think the Dark Lord gave one to Bellatrix Lestrange for safe-keeping - she's one of his most loyal followers, a very powerful witch. And a bit crazy."
    
    "And you think she brought it here? Why <em>here</em>?" Dean demanded, regretfully tabling his Horcrux jokes for the time being.
    
    "We think she kept whatever it is in her bank vault to begin with," Luna said. "But when she realized Harry knew about it, she escaped with it. We don't know for certain whether she brought it here, but she and her husband have three houses in your country. It's... difficult to get in and out of Britain at the moment, so we think she decided that taking it out of the country was the safest way to keep it away from us."
    
    "And one of these houses is out in the woods near here," Dean said. "So you and your friend -" He noticed the flicker of pain that passed over Luna's face, but kept going. "- You were checking out the house. Did you find the... the whore - Did you find it?"
    
    "No," Luna said quietly, looking down at her glass. "We were still searching when the Death Eaters - the Dark Lord's followers - found us. We tried to get away - we wanted to go back later, try again - but there were too many of them, and one of them managed to hit Ginny with an Unforgivable Curse."
    
    Dean couldn't help but feel sorry at the look on Luna's face. "She gonna be okay?"
    
    Luna turned her glass around and around. "I don't know. I activated my Portkey - it's a magical object which transports you over long distances. It should have taken her back to Britain, to a safe place. They'll do what they can to help her."
    
    "Hey, you healed your cut like it was nothing," Dean reminded her, wondering why he was trying to cheer her up. "I bet she'll be fine."
    
    Luna shook her head slowly. "The curse they used on her... it causes pain. Imagine the most pain you've ever felt in your entire life, and then multiply it by... a lot."
    
    Dean couldn't help but remember the necromancer he'd run into three weeks ago. The scar on the back of his neck seemed to burn again as he thought about it.
    
    "Concentrated pain," Luna said, barely above a whisper. "It drives the victim mad, sooner or later. The Death Eaters held it on her for... a minute or two, I don't know how long exactly. She was screaming." She lifted her glass and took another sip of her juice. "So I don't know if she'll be okay. I hope so. Ginny's a good friend. But I've no way to get in touch with anyone to find out."
    
    Dean took a swallow of his coffee. It wasn't like there was anything he could say to make it better.
    
    "So," he said after a moment. "What's your plan now? Head back home?"
    
    "No," Luna said. "I have to go back to the house and look again."
    
    Dean frowned at her. "How do you know the guys in the masks won't come back again?"
    
    "I don't," Luna said. "But I need to find out whether the Horcrux is there or not."
    
    Dean thought about it, then shrugged. Wasn't like it was any of his business, whether she wanted to get herself killed or not. On the other hand, he was there to stop any more innocent people from getting murdered by witches and evil wizards and whatever the fuck else.
    
    "Fine," he said shortly, setting his cup down on the table with a hard <em>clack</em>. "We'll both go."
    
    Luna met his eyes, looking surprised for the first time since he'd met her. "Why?"
    
    "People have been dying in those woods," Dean reminded her. "I want it stopped. You're a witch, right? There's got to be something you can do."
    
    Luna looked thoughtful. "I might be able to tamper with the protections on the house..."
    
    "Right," Dean said, and got to his feet. "So let's go."
    
    <hr>
    
    The walk through the woods took a while, and the way Luna kept her wand in her hand made Dean even more nervous, even if she just seemed to be using it to figure out what direction they should be going.
    
    Dean didn't break the silence between them, busy thinking about what she'd told him. Crazy though it was, he believed her. He'd seen too many fucked-up things to discount it just because of how weird it was. And the fight he'd witnessed did a lot to sell her story. Fine. It didn't mean he was about to start trusting her. Even if she was on the 'good' side of whatever crazy war was going on in her world, it didn't change the fact that she was a witch. And Dean wasn't about to start trusting goddamn witches any time soon.
    
    Luna paused and Dean eyed her edgily. "What?"
    
    "The clearing where we fought the Death Eaters should be just up ahead," Luna said. "It would be safer to circle round it, but I'd like to check whether our things are still there."
    
    "Things?" Dean asked warily.
    
    "Belongings," Luna said vaguely. "Supplies." She started moving again, wand still in her hand.
    
    Dean muttered a curse under his breath and went with her, pulling out his gun.
    
    The clearing was deserted, but Luna didn't appear to relax, and Dean couldn't either, not with the memory of the way the masked figures had just <em>vanished </em>the day before. He figured he couldn't count on seeing or hearing them approaching through the woods.
    
    Damn, but he hated magic.
    
    Luna was looking around, her expression distracted. She moved to the side of the clearing where she'd fought the day before, and he saw her eyes land on the bloodstained ground where her friend had been lying. She didn't say anything, however, just continued on, studying the ground now. Dean followed, splitting his attention between keeping an eye on her and watching out for evil magicians teleporting in.
    
    Luna paused at the far edge of the clearing, crouching down and parting the bushes, standing up again a moment later with two small bags in her hand. Her attention was on the ground again, and she walked slowly around the edge of the clearing.
    
    "What are you looking for?" Dean asked finally.
    
    "Ginny's wand," Luna replied. "It might not be here any more, if the Death Eaters came back and found it, but..." She paused, then flourished her own wand. "<em>Accio</em>, Ginny's wand!"
    
    Dean took an involuntary step back as a wand flew out of a crack between two tree roots and into Luna's hand.
    
    "That must come in handy when you lose your keys," he said, trying not to let it unsettle him too much.
    
    "You Muggles use keys more than we do," Luna said. "We usually stick to locking charms." She smiled at him, slipping the wand into one of the bags, then one bag inside the other. The remaining bag she slung over her shoulder and onto her back. "The house is this way."
    
    It was hard to follow her now, somehow. It wasn't like he couldn't see where she was going, but there was no path, and the trees and bushes seemed to be doing their best to thwart him. He kept going off-track.
    
    "Oh," Luna said suddenly, coming back to his side. "Is it hard for you to find your way?"
    
    "No," Dean said defiantly. Damned if he was going to let her show him up. "It's just a bit tricky to see the wood for the trees out here."
    
    Luna blinked at him, but before he could properly savor the triumph of confusing <em>her</em> for once, she said, "You should hold my hand."
    
    Dean stared at her. "Um, not that I'm complaining, sweetheart, but we only just met."
    
    "Don't worry, you don't need to be shy," Luna said, catching hold of his hand and interlacing her fingers with his. "You're not a wizard, so the protections on the house are trying to turn you away. If we hold hands, the house knows you're with me and leaves you in peace."
    
    She started walking again and Dean went with her, trying not to think about the cool hand in his.
    
    "Thought there'd be more hocus-pocus involved," he muttered. "Not just <em>holding hands</em>."
    
    "Holding hands can be very powerful," Luna said dreamily. "Like the old handfasting ceremonies when people got married..."
    
    Dean only just stopped himself from yanking his hand away. "<em>What</em>?"
    
    "Besides, just casting a spell wouldn't have been nearly as much fun," Luna said.
    
    Dean looked at her suspiciously, but her serene expression gave nothing away.

    <p>The tree-house is a godsend.<br /> <br /> John's boys are good kids, but they're still <em>kids</em>, full of energy and liable to get into every which thing. It's a marvel John can keep them under control as well as he does; Dean with his itching desire to take apart any goddamned piece of machinery he sees, whole Sam trails around after him getting into everything and asking questions until it's enough to drive a man to drink. It wouldn't be so bad if he and John were just working in the yard - Dean at least is plenty old enough to learn his way around the innards of a car; pretty handy at it, too - but if the case they're working as anything John could do in front of the boys, he probably wouldn't be here.</p>
    <p><br /> The first week they're happy enough exploring the yard, scoping out their territory. Dean sets to climbing every tree in the orchard, Sammy following doggedly behind him, red-faced and determined as he struggles to keep up. They tackle all the little fruit trees first, leaving the ash tree out on the west of the property till last. It's not the hardest tree to climb, but it's the biggest, been there longer than the house has. Dean shins up the trunk first and ties a rope to the lowest branch, but Sam ignores the help, kicking off his shoes so he can dig toes as well as fingers into the cracks in the bark. When he finally makes it he persuades Dean to carve both their initials into the bark, and they both sit there all afternoon, grinning out over the valley.</p>
    <p align="center"><br /> Once they've cracked the ash tree, though, they're both back to poking around the yard, looking for mischief to get into. So when John leans back one evening and says, 'Used to build treehouses when I was a kid', Bobby seizes on it for the inspiration it is.</p>
    <p align="right"><br /> "Built one or two myself. We had a great treehouse out on my granddaddy's old place, big enough me and both my brothers could fit it." He takes a long pull on his beer, pretending like he can't see the way Dean and Sammy have both pricked up their ears. "He had a big old ash tree, like that one out back."<br /> <br /></p>
    <ul>
    <li>John nods wisely, the corner of his mouth twitching as he says, "Yeah, that's the right kind of tree, sure enough."</li>
    <li>Sam lets out a little squeak of excitement, and Bobby has to take another drink before he can compose himself enough to speak. "'Course, it was a mighty lot of work. Can't think kids nowadays would have the sticking power."</li>
    <li>"<em>We</em> would, Uncle Bobby!" Sam bursts out. "We could build one, couldn't we, Dean?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Dean shushes him, saying, "It's not our tree, Sam," but his face is just as shining and hopeful as his brother's.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Bobby catches John's eye. "I got no objections."</li>
    <li>Finally he relents. "If you really want to do this, you've gotta do it right, you hear? That means you too, Sammy. You mind what your brother tells you."</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br /> <br /> <strong>He fixes Dean with a stern look. "And you look after your brother. We don't need any broken necks."</strong><br /> <br /> <u>The two of them <em>yessir</em> and <em>nosir</em>, nodding fervently, and the second John dismisses them they burst out into the yard, already arguing about the best way to plan the project and whether or not it's dumb to give the tree-house windows.</u> Bobby remembers that the first time he built a tree-house, he dragged half the lumber he could find up the tree before stopping to figure out how it would all fit together, but Dean and Sam have the whole thing sketched out on paper before they even start looking for materials. And if the yard yields some surprisingly useful scraps - well, it just goes to show that planning pays off.<br /> <br /> <strike>Between keeping an eye on the boys and finding ways to keep them well-supplied with building materials, Bobby and John finish up the job they've been working on. The demon they've been after leaves them both bloody and exhausted</strike> before they manage to send it back to hell, but even so, it's only a couple of days before John's edgy and restless, hunting through newspapers and clipping out obituaries and disappearances.<br /> <br /> When he starts hunting through the maps,</p>
    <p>looking for one of Ohio,</p>
    <p>Bobby observes mildly,</p>
    <p>"They've only just finished that tree-house."</p>
    <p><br /> "I know," John says regretfully, but he doesn't stop comparing the scribbled notes he's made against the unfolded map.</p>
    <p><br /> <br /></p>
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>Bobby watches   him thoughtfully, thinking about the pleased-proud look on Dean's face when   they pronounced the tree-house safe. "You can pick them up after the   job's done."</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>John does pause   then, looks up slowly, like if he moves too quick Bobby'll take it back.   "You're a good man, Bobby."</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>"Not   particularly." Bobby fishes in his pocket for his pack of cigarettes, a   habit he still hasn't gotten around to quitting. "Just mind you pick   them up before the school year starts."</strong></p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>John leaves the   boys at the yard the next summer, too, but the one after that he calls and   says he's keeping them with him, holing up in a cabin in the woods somewhere   while he hunts down a possible Raksha. "The boys are old enough   now," he says. "Dean can handle a gun like you wouldn't believe."</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p>Bobby says nothing, letting the   silence stretch out across the line.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p>"Well, I guess we'll see you soon   enough," John says finally.</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>They don't come   by that summer, though, and by the next they're on the other side of the   country, and Bobby's busy with his own affairs. He sees them off and on over   the next few years, but always for one-off jobs, and they don't make it back   to his place. Figures that John's heard the message in Bobby's silences and   chosen to deal with it his own way.</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><br /> He's less surprised than he should be when the letters start to arrive. The   first two he just stashes in the bookcase and forgets about. When the third   one arrives, though - thick and heavy with promises - he picks up the phone.   He doesn't need the return address on that thick envelope - <em>Stanford University</em> - to tell him that   John doesn't need to know about the letters. Instead he says, "Got a job   I could use your help with," brushing aside John's surprise at the call.<br /> <br /></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><br /> It's a shock when Bobby makes the rendezvous to find John standing there with   two young men. Not like he didn't know the boys were growing up, but there's   knowing and then there's seeing Dean standing shoulder-to-shoulder with John,   plotting out hunt strategies while Sammy towers over them both.<br /> <br /></p>

    <p>So, my name's Jessica Moore, and it you know anything about me at all you'll know I died. A few years ago now, actually, and I'm as surprised as anyone to find that apparently that doesn't preclude me walking and talking and all that.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It apparently precludes me touching anyone else, though, which sucks. Particularly since that pretty much rules out continuing with the awesomely hot sex I was enjoying with Sam Winchester.</p>

    "Seriously," Sam says. "Did you mean what you said before? You never have nightmares? Even with all the things we face every day?"
    
    "No, never," Dean says.
    
    It's not exactly a lie.
    
    <hr>
    
    The first time he had the dream, he was four years old. The only reason he even remembered, later, that that was when it all began, was because when he woke up screaming and didn't stop, the Guenthers took him to the hospital to see his parents.
    
    Daddy hugged him, but Dean didn't really stop crying until the nurse let them into the room where Mommy was sitting up in bed. Mommy looked tired, but she smiled when Daddy lifted him up to sit next to her, and she helped him carefully position his arms to support the bundle she put in them.
    
    "Dean, this is your baby brother," she said. "His name's Sam."
    
    Dean stared into Sam's wide, fascinated eyes, and felt his nightmare of pain and blood and fire slip into insignificance.
    
    "Hi, Sammy," he whispered.
    
    <hr>
    
    It's not really Dad's disappearance or his weird voicemail that send Dean to Sam. Which is not to say he's not worried, because he is: damn close to panic, if he's honest. Dad's taken off on solo hunts plenty of times, but never like this. Never without agreeing on a meet-up point first. Never without getting in touch every few days.
    
    But two and a half weeks after Dad vanishes, Dean dreams of being pinned to the ceiling again, and this time Sam is looking up at him, his eyes wide and horrified.
    
    He has the same dream two nights in a row, and knows the only reason he doesn't have it again the third night is because he doesn't sleep, driving through the night to California.
    
    <hr>
    
    The first year after the dream started, he had it a lot. He used to wake up screaming and terrified until Mommy came and hugged him.
    
    "It's not real, baby," she said soothingly, one night after the dream was particularly bad. "See, there's no fire. You're fine, everything's okay. Feel the bed?"
    
    Dean patted the mattress hesitantly, and scrunched his fingers up in the comforter.
    
    "See? It's real," Mommy said. "So if you ever wake up and you're scared, just tap the bed like that and you'll know it's real and you're awake."
    
    Dean looked up at her. "But you'll come, won't you, Mommy?"
    
    Mommy coaxed him into lying back down and tucked the sheets back over him. "I'll always come if I hear you, baby. But if I don't, you can come and find me, okay?"
    
    "Okay," Dean said, and closed his eyes.
    
    "That's my brave boy," Mommy said, and kissed his forehead. "Go back to sleep, Dean. Angels are watching over you, and I'm not going anywhere."
    
    <hr>
    
    There's not much time for sleep over the weekend, not with Sam insisting that he needs to be back in Palo Alto by Monday. Dean's still hoping that his brother will change his mind and come with him to keep looking for Dad, but he knows better than to expect it. Sam's changed a lot in the past few years, but he's not gotten any less stubborn.
    
    The few hours of sleep Dean does manage to snatch are full of fire and blood and Sam's horrified eyes.
    
    He really, really doesn't want to just drop his brother off and drive away like nothing's wrong, but Sam doesn't leave him much choice. It's not until he looks at the clock and notices, <em>really </em>notices the date and time that Dean figures it out.
    
    By the time he reaches Sam's apartment, he's walking into his nightmare. He drags Sam out of there, and doesn't spare Jess more than a glance.
    
    He's already lived this through her eyes, and he's pretty sure he'll be seeing her again in his dreams.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean was nearly five the first time his dream came true.
    
    He'd woken up from it again, the same nightmare he always had. But it had been different this time - instead of him staring down into darkness, there had been yellow eyes looking up at him.
    
    Dean shivered and pressed his hand against the mattress the way Mommy had taught him. <em>Be brave, Dean</em>. He guessed Mommy hadn't heard him - she always came when he had his dream. But she'd said he could go and find her if she didn't. And he knew he had to tell her about the yellow eyes.
    
    He slipped out of bed and was almost at the door when the feeling of <em>wrong wrong wrong</em> hit him. Frantic, he pressed a hand against the wall, solid beneath his palm. He was awake. This was real. But somehow it felt like he was still in the middle of his dream.
    
    He could smell the smoke of the fire from his nightmare. 
    
    Dean took a deep breath and made himself turn the door handle. He needed to find Mommy.
    
    Out in the hallway, the stink of smoke was stronger, and the air was hot. Dean went towards the heat, because if this was his nightmare, he needed to see it.
    
    Daddy found him first, though, thrusting Sammy into his arms. The look in Daddy's eyes made Dean feel even more scared, but he tightened his hold on Sammy.
    
    "Take your brother outside as fast as you can - don't look back," Daddy told him. 
    
    Dean was still staring at the door to Sammy's nursery. <i>That's where the fire is. That's where the thing with the yellow eyes is</i>.
    
    <i>That's where Mommy is</i>.
    
    "Now, Dean, <em>go</em>!" Daddy shouted, and Dean turned and ran, clutching Sammy to him.
    
    Afterwards, shivering and pressed to Daddy's side, Dean wished that Mommy would come and make the nightmare go away again this time.
    
    <hr>
    
    They're in Toledo, Ohio, when Dean's patience with Sam's self-loathing finally runs out.
    
    "Now listen to me: it <em>wasn't your fault</em>. If you want to blame something, then blame the thing that killed her. Or hell, why don't you take a swing at me? I mean, I'm the one that dragged you away from her in the first place."
    
    <i>And I didn't figure out it was her I was dreaming about. I didn't insist on sticking around, even though I knew something was coming. If anyone should have been giving warnings, Sam, it was me, not you.</i>
    
    "I don't blame you," Sam says, soft but sincere. It doesn't make Dean feel any better.
    
    When Bloody Mary makes his eyes bleed, later, he doesn't know who it's for: Jess, or Mom, or any of the others. But he does know that in his case it's deserved.
    
    <hr>
    
    "- and then it turned into a flower and caught me," Lucy told the class, all in one breath.
    
    "That sounds like a very nice dream," Mrs. Marshall said brightly. "Why don't you draw a picture of the flower, Lucy? Okay, who's next... Tim? Can you tell everyone about the last dream you remember?"
    
    Dean sat very quietly, doodling on his piece of paper and listening to the other children talk about their dreams. It was like looking out a window onto a strange world. He'd never really realized that other people had lots of different dreams, not just the same one all the time. He'd never known dreams could be about things like flowers catching you when you fall, or driving a train that turns into a boat.
    
    He sat and listened, and hoped that Mrs. Marshall wouldn't call on him.
    
    <hr>
    
    "I have these nightmares," Sam says.
    
    "I've noticed," Dean replies. 'Noticed' is putting it mildly. Sam's been waking up damn near every night, screaming as often as not. Dean's been trying to get him to open up about them for months, and if Sam's finally ready to talk, great. Though Dean still doesn't see the connection to the old house in Lawrence.
    
    "And sometimes... they come true," Sam says.
    
    Dean can't even take that in. Sam did <em>not</em> just say - "Come again?"
    
    "Look, Dean - I dreamt about Jessica's death. For days before it happened."
    
    Dean has never once considered that he might not be the only one to have the dream. It's never even crossed his mind before. Ever since he realized, back when he was a kid, that other people had more than one dream and their nightmares didn't come true, he's known that it's just him, that he's different. Sam talked about lots of dreams, growing up. Surely Dean would have known if Sam had been having the same dream as him?
    
    His mind is whirling too much for him to do more than offer some B.S. about coincidences, but coincidence is one thing he's never been a big believer in.
    
    <hr>
    
    The dream lost some of its terror, after a while. It became familiar. Dean stopped waking up screaming a month or two after Mom died; he just lay there and pressed his hand against the mattress and waited for his breathing to slow down. A few years later, he barely woke up at all, his eyes blinking open only for a moment, his hand tightening around the comforter or his pillow, just enough to reassure himself he was awake before he dozed off again.
    
    Sometimes he wondered if the reason the dream no longer scared him as much was because it was the only link he still had to Mom. He couldn't exactly feel her presence, but he knew he had to be reliving what happened to her. Even that kind of indirect connection meant something.
    
    The dream never exactly became comforting, but it did eventually become normal.
    
    <hr>
    
    Mom looks exactly like how he remembers her from that night, but at the same time completely different. He guesses it's because he's not four years old any more. And because she's apparently a <em>ghost</em>. 
    
    He can't even think, as if his entire mind is shutting down in self-defense. He can only stare at her as she smiles at him. When she finally steps past him to speak to Sam, he turns to watch, even though he knows he should be keeping guard, watching for whatever has got Sam pinned. But there's no way he can take his eyes off her.
    
    Watching her vanish into flames for the second and the millionth time makes him want to kill things, and at the same time makes him want to curl up somewhere like he's four again.
    
    After that, the dream stops feeling like a connection to her. She's gone, truly gone. And he knows, somehow, that it's not really her death he's reliving. It hasn't been for a long time, if it ever was.
    
    His dreams are about the future, not the past. It's his own death he's dreaming of, and somewhere deep down, he's always known that.
    
    <hr>
    
    "I just..." Sammy huffed and fell down face forward onto his bed. "Don't you ever wish we could just be normal?"
    
    Dean looked up from his magazine. "What are you talking about?"
    
    Sam waved one arm vaguely, not bothering to raise his head. "Like a normal life! Where Dad's a... a mechanic or something, and we don't hunt, and all we've got to worry about is homework and tests and stuff. Don't you ever want something different?"
    
    Dean thought of the dream he was having almost every night. "No point in wanting the impossible."
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean doesn't know why he's surprised when Sam takes off for California instead of coming with him to investigate the case Dad's given them. Sam's always been this way - never follows orders, never just accepts what fate seems to be dishing out for him. Sam's always been convinced he can control his own life and do whatever he wants. It's something Dean doesn't really <em>get</em>, never has. He dreams about his own death most nights. He already knows what fate's got in store for him, and he's already seen it come true once, for his mother.
    
    He's always known there are some fates you can't escape. Particularly when you're a Winchester. But somehow Sam's never gotten that memo.
    
    He calls Sam, tells him he's proud of him for standing up to Dad and doing whatever he wants to do with his life, making his own choices. It's the truth; it's not like Dean's never wished things were different. He's just a realist: his fate's already written, and it's not one he's got a choice in.
    
    <hr>
    
    The dream varied slightly on occasion: once or twice he could feel someone else's presence with him on the ceiling, and what he saw below him wasn't always the same. But the dream only once changed so much that he was the one looking <em>up </em>at the ceiling.
    
    "Go to sleep, Dean," Cassie murmured, pressing kisses to his eyelids. "Dream of me."
    
    He did.
    
    By the time Dad called the next morning to say they had a job and needed to leave town, Dean's bags were already packed.
    
    <hr>
    
    The phone call from Cassie asking for his help almost makes Dean panic. He's not stupid enough to think that just because he's never had that variant of the dream again, it'll definitely never come true. So it comes almost as a relief to discover she's calling because she's got a psycho ghost truck on her hands, of all things.
    
    It's intense, seeing her again. After that version of the dream he made damn sure not to get that close to anyone else. Now, after what happened to Jess, he's even more certain that he's putting her in more danger just by being there. Maybe it's the fate that anyone who gets involved with a Winchester will suffer. Though that alone doesn't explain most of his dreams, because though some have been premonitions of someone else's death, most of them are about his.
    
    He's only human, though, and Cassie is special. They fall into bed together, and Dean doesn't regret it.
    
    He just makes sure he stays awake all night, keeping watch while she sleeps, his gun within reach.
    
    <hr>
    
    The dreams stopped coming for almost three years after Sam left for Stanford. Dean had never slept worse in his life.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dad dying is a worse nightmare than his dream, and this one Dean can't wake up from.
    
    He knows what Dad did, why he did it, and it messes with his head, but the truth is he's so fucked up by what Dad told him that he can barely focus on the rest of it.
    
    Killing Sam is just - it's not an option. Never. Dean doesn't know how Dad could even suggest it.
    
    His dream changes again, though, or rather, develops more variations. Sometimes Sam is still staring up at him in horror. Sometimes, though, his eyes are black, and he smiles. Sometimes he licks Dean's blood off his lips. Once or twice his eyes are yellow, and those nights Dean wakes up in a cold sweat and can't go back to sleep.
    
    He doesn't know which is worse: seeing his brother's horror, or seeing the lack of it.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean thought about telling Dad, once or twice. Mostly when the dream got really bad, or there was a variation that worried him. He never got up the courage, though.
    
    Partly it was simple fear of Dad's reaction to the fact that Dean had kept something like this from him. Partly it was the fear - irrational, he knew - that Dad would blame him for Mom's death, feel he should have been able to warn her or Dad, somehow prevent it.
    
    Partly it was the fear that Dad would look at him like he did the supernatural things he hunted.
    
    <hr>
    
    Sam's angry when he finds out what Dad told Dean before he died - angry at Dad, and angry at Dean for not telling him sooner. Dean begs for time to fix things. He's scared, because now Sam's the one talking like he believes in inevitable and immutable fate, and that's always been Dean's territory. Suddenly Dean's the one who needs to believe that there's such a thing as free choice, that fate, if it exists, can be changed. His own death is one thing - he's been dreaming about it for long enough to be a realist about that - but the thought of losing Sam, of Sam going dark side, of Sam needing to be killed... that's not something Dean can accept.
    
    When Sam begs him - <em>begs </em>him - to promise to kill him if Sam turns into something they hunt, Dean makes the promise, and holds on to the versions of his dream where Sam's eyes are horrified when he looks up.
    
    His dream has variations for a reason, he has to believe that. They're all possible, and Dean's already made his choice.
    
    Sam's changed since Dad died, and Dean thinks there's more to it than just that loss, but he doesn't know what it is. Sam's more focused on him; he's stopped talking about leaving. He touches Dean more when he thinks he can get away with it. But Dean doesn't put the pieces together, not for a long while.
    
    Not until Sam sits down beside him one morning and reaches out to touch his face, turning his head until their eyes meet.
    
    There's a moment of stillness when Dean finally <em>gets</em> it, all of it: gets why Sam has been acting the way he has. Gets why he's always had the dream.
    
    Right now, it doesn't feel like fate. It feels like a choice.
    
    When Sam's lips brush his, Dean sees flames and blood in his mind's eye.
    
    He kisses Sam back.

  summary: 
  content: |
    The first time Dean accompanied his father on a hunt, he was eight years old.
    
    It was a simple salt and burn, nothing more complicated, or John wouldn't have taken him along at all. Even then, it only happened because Sam was still recovering from a stomach bug and was staying with Pastor Jim. Dean had been begging his father to let him come along and help ever since he was six and had learned to shoot, but he knew the first priority had to be protecting Sammy, and that was his job. With Sammy in safe hands, though, his father took Dean along on his "business trip" that evening.
    
    The graveyard was dark and deserted, and Dean clutched the salt and the lighter fluid tightly as he followed his father between the graves. He wanted to ask his father how he knew where the grave they were looking for was, but something about the darkness of the cemetery didn't permit questions.
    
    "Here we are," his father said finally, setting down the shovel he was carrying. "Marie Leyman." Dean studied the grave, trying to look as confident as if this was nothing new, nothing out of the ordinary. The stone had only the name and dates carved into it. He counted silently in his head: she'd been 24 years old when she'd died. The funeral hadn't been that long ago: there were still flowers on top of the grave, wilted and turning brown.
    
    "Her ghost has been haunting the bridge where she died," his father told him. "So we're going to lay her to rest, Dean. We're going to dig until we find her coffin, and then salt and burn her corpse."
    
    Dean liked that "we". It felt awesome to finally be able to help. "Can I help to dig?"
    
    His father laughed. "I think the shovel might be a bit heavy for you, kiddo. Tell you what, why don't you clear those flowers out of the way? That'd be a great help. Just pile them across there, we'll put them back when we're done."
    
    Dean set the salt and lighter fluid down, then stepped up to the grave. It felt weird, taking the woman's flowers, but it was probably okay if he was going to put them back.
    
    There was a bunch of white roses, petals crinkled up and brown along the edges. Dean lifted them gingerly and carried them out of the way, swallowing hard as the smell wafted up at him, sickly sweet amidst the rot. There was an arrangement of mixed flowers, yellow and pink and purple, he thought, though he didn't know their names and the colours were hard to make out now. Some of the flowers had withered completely, were hard to the touch and shrivelled beyond recognition. Others were still dying, and those were almost worse. Their smell hadn't faded entirely.
    
    Dean was glad when the last of the flowers were out of the way.
    
    "Good," his father said, and picked up the shovel. "Okay, Dean, watch and see how it's done, and maybe you can help with this part next time."
    
    Dean watched with interest as his father dug up the grave. It took longer than he'd expected, and there was a lot of soil piled on the edge by the time his father said, "Okay, here's the coffin. See, Dean?"
    
    He had to stand right on the edge to see down, because the hole his father had dug was very deep.
    
    "Okay," his father said. "I'm going to use the shovel to open the coffin. It's not going to look or smell pretty, so I want you to go back a few steps and put your hand over your nose, got that, Dean?"
    
    Dean half-wanted to argue - he wasn't some clueless little kid who needed to be protected - but he knew better than to talk back to his father, particularly on a hunt. Besides, part of him wasn't entirely sure he really wanted to see. The flowers and the grave were creepy enough. A dead body... He backed off a few paces and obediently covered his nose.
    
    There were several sharp cracking sounds as his father smashed open the coffin. Dean suppressed his curiosity with an effort and picked up the salt, keeping one hand over his nose. 
    
    His father tossed the shovel back up onto the edge of the grave, then pulled himself out after it. Dean carried the salt across to him.
    
    "Thanks, Dean," his father said, getting to his feet and taking the canister from him. "Would you pass me the lighter fluid, too?"
    
    Dean did so while his father scattered salt down into the hole, then Dean picked up the shovel to carry it back out of the way. He couldn't help glancing down for a moment, that close to the edge.
    
    The body was gross. Seriously gross. Dean kept his hand clamped across his nose and backed away with the shovel as quickly as he could, struggling to drag it with only one free hand.
    
    His father sprinkled lighter fluid into the hole too, then pulled out a book of matches. "Next time we do this, you can do this part, Dean, okay? If it's just bones we're dealing with."
    
    "Cool," Dean said, muffled by his hand. He was just as glad his father wasn't about to let him do that this time. Cool though it would be, he didn't really want to see that rotting body again, the sight of all that blonde hair surrounded by decomposing flesh, mottled and wrinkling like the flowers he'd moved away from the grave.
    
    Afterwards, when they arrived back at Pastor Jim's, Dean took a long shower, trying to scrub the smell off himself. Not so much the smell of the smoke, but the sweet, dead scent of the decaying flowers.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Pastor Jim's garden was small: the grounds of the church weren't particularly large, and there were only a few flower beds over by the wall. Sammy was picking flowers when Dean found him.
    
    "Look, Dean!" Sammy exclaimed happily, thrusting the bunch he was holding towards his brother. "Pretty flowers!"
    
    Dean swallowed hard and managed not to take a step back. "Sammy - you can't just pick them!"
    
    Sammy looked worried for a moment, then brightened. "But Pastor Jim said I could! Said they'll look pretty in our room and smell nice too. Look, roses!"
    
    Dean stared at the roses - mostly just the heads, really, as Sammy had evidently struggled with the thick stems. "Yeah, I see that." All he could see in his mind's eye was the decaying flowers he'd moved from the grave the week before, wilted and dead.
    
    "Don't you like them?" Sammy asked, looking crestfallen.
    
    Dean forced himself to smile. It wasn't Sammy's fault, after all. He was too young to know he'd killed all the pretty flowers he was holding. "No, they're... nice, Sammy. Pretty."
    
    Sammy beamed again. "Come help me put them in a vase!"
    
    The vase of flowers ended up in the kitchen, much to Dean's relief. He wasn't sure how well he'd have been able to sleep if they'd been put in their bedroom. The sickly sweet scent of the flowers was enough to put him off his food.
    
    In bed that night, Sammy said, "Dean?"
    
    Dean turned his head to look across at him. "What?"
    
    Sammy's voice was very small when he asked, "Did Mom like flowers? Is that why...?"
    
    Dean turned away. "Go to sleep, Sammy."
    
    The truth was, he didn't know whether Mom had liked flowers. He couldn't remember seeing her with any, but that didn't mean anything. His memories of her were fading, slipping away from him. The thought of blonde hair brought back clearer memories of the half-glimpsed corpse from the week before than of his mother.
    
    He was losing her again, and it wasn't Sammy's fault - Sammy couldn't remember her at all, which always made Dean feel sorry for him - but Dean couldn't talk about her, not now.
    
    He thought about asking their father whether Mom had liked flowers, and wondered whether the chance of getting an answer was high enough to make it worth his father's inevitable drinking session afterwards.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Palo Alto was surprisingly cold in January, or maybe Dean was just an emo little bitch.
    
    He had every right to be there, he told himself. Palo Alto was totally on the way to Arizona. Okay, so maybe not when you were starting from Utah, but hell, it wasn't like anyone gave a damn.
    
    Even though he had every right to be there, he wasn't sure Sam would agree he had the right to follow him around all afternoon. But what Sammy didn't know wouldn't hurt him.
    
    He sat up straighter in the Impala as Sam ducked unexpectedly into a store on the corner. He'd been expecting Sam to head straight back to his dorm, but evidently Sam had an errand to run. At the florist's.
    
    Dean frowned, then slid slower again in his seat when Sam re-emerged a few minutes later holding a huge bouquet. No roses, but lots of pink carnations and white sprinkly flowers, all wrapped up in clear plastic so they could fake being alive for a bit longer.
    
    Sam headed off in a direction Dean wasn't familiar with - not his dorm, not where his classes were held, not work, not the library. Presumably he was going to take the bouquet to whatever chick he'd bought it for. Dean wondered whether to follow.
    
    His cell phone rang in his pocket, and Dean pulled it out, hitting the button. "Hey."
    
    "Hey, Dean," his father said warmly. "Happy birthday, son."
    
    Dean watched Sam turn the corner, flowers in hand. "Thanks, Dad."
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Sam didn't speak on the way to the cemetery.
    
    Dean didn't bother casting around for something to say. He wasn't too good with words at the best of times, and they weren't going to do a goddamn thing to help Sam at the moment. In the silence, the scent of the flowers in Sam's lap seemed to expand and fill the whole car, overpowering and deathly sweet.
    
    Sam was staring at them, or through them. Dean wasn't sure which.
    
    "She hated roses," Sam said unexpectedly as they pulled up next to the graveyard.
    
    Dean darted a quick glance at him. Sam's voice was unsteady, and he was still staring at the flowers. The suit was all wrong on him, made him look like a stranger, not the Sammy that Dean knew at all.
    
    "They're nice," Dean hazarded. "Those ones, I mean." He didn't say <em>I'm sure she'd like them</em>; he didn't think he had that right.
    
    "Yeah," Sam said, and fell silent again, before finally getting out of the car.
    
    Dean let him go to the grave by himself, and was waiting when he came back, blank-eyed and silent.
    
    The scent of the flowers lingered all the way back to the motel.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Okay, Sam was gigantic enough at the best of times. There was absolutely no call for there to be <em>two</em> of him. That was just unfair.
    
    "Dean?" both of the Sams asked. "How many fingers am I holding up?"
    
    Dean tried to focus. "Which one of you?"
    
    "Uh-huh," the Sams said. "Okay, c'mon, big brother."
    
    Dean thought the whole pulling-to-feet plan would have worked better if the Sams had taken a side each, but the world was spinning a bit too dizzily for him to complain other than by groaning. He leaned against the nearest Sam and held on.
    
    "Easy," Sam's voice said soothingly. At least he hadn't cloned his voice, too. "It tossed you against that gravestone pretty hard, huh? The thorns on those roses have bloodied your face up, too."
    
    Well, that explained why his cheek was stinging. "Fucking flowers," Dean muttered and held on tighter to Sam as his brother tried to move. The moving thing was not a good idea, he felt.
    
    "C'mon, Dean," Sam coaxed. "Back to the car, then we'll go to the hospital and get you patched up, okay?"
    
    Oh no. Not okay at all. The world was spinning too horribly for him to speak, but something of his feelings must have been communicated to Sam, because his brother said, "Dean, you've got a concussion, man. We're <em>going</em> to the hospital."
    
    An arm settled more securely across Dean's shoulder, supporting him. Dean didn't open his eyes to see which of the Sams it belonged to, though.
    
    A year or two ago he'd have been able to order Sam to drive back to the motel instead, but Sam had gotten touchy since he'd broken Dean's deal. He'd take Dean to the hospital for a splinter these days, given half a chance, and never mind the fact that the FBI was after them and their insurance was non-existent.
    
    Fuck, his head hurt. What the hell had even happened?
    
    <em>Ghost</em>, a scrap of memory prompted unexpectedly. Huh. "Ghost?"
    
    "Gone," Sam said. "I took care of it. But the fact that you're only asking now is exactly why I'm taking you to the hospital."
    
    "No," Dean said, vaguely aware even as he said it that he sounded like a fretful child. He had to convince Sam somehow. "Sam - Sammy, no. Hate hospitals. Motel."
    
    "I know you don't like them, but I want a doctor to take a look at whatever damage you've managed to do to your head this time," Sam said.
    
    Too many words. "No," Dean tried again. "Too clean, and... ghosts everywhere. And flowers. They bring you <em>flowers</em>, Sam."
    
    Sam had the nerve to sound amused, the bastard. "Sometimes, yeah. I promise they won't claw up your face like those roses, though."
    
    Dean wasn't reassured. "Fucking hate flowers."
    
    His brother huffed a laugh. They stopped moving for a moment, and Dean heard a click before Sam was pushing him gently backwards. Oh. They were at the car. He let Sam manhandle him into place, and tilted his head back gratefully, letting the comforting smell of the Impala surround him.
    
    He heard doors opening and shutting, but they seemed to be coming from a long way off. It took a while for Sam's voice to penetrate. "Dean. Dean!"
    
    Dean groaned softly at the disturbance.
    
    "Dean, you can't go to sleep," Sam said urgently. The engine roared into life. "C'mon, Dean, you know the score. Open your eyes, talk to me."
    
    "Tired," Dean mumbled.
    
    "I know, I know," Sam said. "And you can sleep soon, but not yet, okay? I need you to stay awake for me for now. Talk to me - tell me why you hate flowers or something, Dean. Dean! Hey. They just too girly for you, is that it?"
    
    Dean frowned sluggishly and tried to force his eyes open. "Flowers... not girly, they're <em>creepy</em>. It's fucked up."
    
    "Creepy?" Sam said. He sounded kind of incredulous, but maybe Dean's hearing was just screwed up. "What's creepy about them, Dean? Tell me, come on."
    
    "Fucking dead," Dean told him. "Pretend to be alive, and everyone says <em>oh, so pretty</em>, and they're dead and just don't look like it yet. They're like - like zombies. Fucking zombie flowers, all over the place."
    
    Sam made a choking sound. Dean thought maybe he was getting through to him. "Smell like cemet- cem- graveyards," he continued. It suddenly seemed very important that Sam understand this. "You wake up in hospital, and it's like - you think you've been buried or something, till the drugs wear off, with the smell of them. All the zombie flowers. Zombies don't kill flowers, they just make them look like they should. Already dead to start with. And I never asked Dad if she liked them."
    
    He trailed off, swallowing a weird lump in his throat. God, his head fucking hurt. Where were they even going?
    
    "To the hospital," Sam said, so either his freaky brain powers were making a comeback, or Dean had said that out loud. "But hey, Dean - look, no flowers, okay? I promise."
    
    "Really?" Dean asked cautiously. "Sometimes they bring 'em while I'm sleeping."
    
    "I'll make sure none of the - the zombie flowers get near you," Sam said. His voice sounded weird, kinda choked. "I promise, Dean. I'll keep the zombie flowers away while you're sleeping."
    
    Dean sighed, but relaxed slightly. Sam mostly kept his promises, particularly about saving Dean from things. "Okay. Hospital."
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    The first thing Dean saw when he opened his eyes was Sam grinning at him. It was always an awesome sight to wake up to, no matter what he told Sam.
    
    "Hey," Sam said cheerfully. "How are you feeling?"
    
    "Urgh. Okay," Dean said, touching his head gingerly. "What happened?"
    
    "Concussion. Ghost tossed you into a gravestone," Sam said. "You're in the hospital."
    
    Oh, yeah. Now Sam came to mention it, the overly sterile surroundings did have that hospital feel. Dean glanced around and paused at the sight of something bright and bouquet-shaped on the bedside table.
    
    "Ah," Sam said. The way he was grinning was doing nothing to reassure Dean. "I thought you probably wouldn't appreciate any, um, "zombie flowers" -"
    
    Oh, fuck. What the hell had Dean said while he was out of it?
    
    "- So I got you a chocolate bouquet instead," Sam continued. "All they had were rose-shaped ones, but I figured you'd put up with that, since they don't have any thorns."
    
    Dean stared at the foil-wrapped chocolate flowers. Now Sam mentioned it, he could smell the chocolate.
    
    "No zombies involved," Sam said, fighting to keep a straight face and failing utterly.
    
    Dean scowled at him. "Go find a doctor to bust me out of here, bitch."
    
    "If you're sure you can fend off the zombies while I'm gone -" Sam started, and beat a hasty retreat before Dean could throw the TV remote at him, his laughter echoing down the corridor after him.
    
    Dean watched him go, then reached up and snagged one of the chocolate flowers.

  summary: 
  content: "Well, the Lord is pretty forgiving as a rule, but this was back in the old days, when he wasn't given to pussyfooting around, and things had gotten pretty corrupt in Sodom and Gomorrah - not to mention Admah, Zeboim, and Bela. The drinking, whoring and general depravity was bad enough, but what really set these guys apart was the way they trampled on their own. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Anyway, finally things got to a bad enough pass that the Lord sent me down with some of the boys to take care of things. Of course, these mud monkeys never can accept these things, and when Abaraham got wind of it he begged the Lord to reconsider. Well, at the time the Lord was thinking up this other plan, about being made flesh and all that, so he says if Abraham could find more than a handful of righteous souls in one of these cities then he'd think again on the wholesale smiting. He could only find the one, though - this guy Lot - so that was off.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To do Lot justice, he was okay. When me and the boys went down to give him fair warning, the degenerates in Sodom got pretty interested. We used to pick good looking vessels, back in the day (well, some of us still do, but these days I go for inspiring respect rather than a pretty face). So, they came baying at the doors, asking for a piece of us. Lot, though, he knew his duty, and he wasn't going to insult the Lord like that. He offered up his daughters instead, mind you. Mud monkeys, they make no sense to me. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Since Lot was a good sort, we got him and his people out of the city. Told them not to look back, too, because we were planning some pretty righteous smiting. Of course, there always has to be one who doesn't listen, and sure enough his wife had to turn back. Pillar of salted her: regrettable, but what can you do? People should follow instructions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So, we did some flattening of the city - fire, brimstone, the whole works. Some of the best fun I've had in eternity, I have to admit. Lot was well out of it, but those daughters of his took some fool notion to have a baby, and he was the only man around. So it goes. "

    Rory's already in bed when Dean comes up, sprawled on top of the covers with her nose in a book. She looks up when he settles on the edge of the bed, sticks her finger in the book to mark her place while she gives him a quick kiss, then goes back to reading.
    
    Dean rests his hand on Rory's thigh, sliding it up under fabric and savoring the warm smoothness of her skin. "Stealing my shorts again," he remarks, and she <i>hmms</i> in response, wriggling a little against the pressure of his hand without pausing in her reading. He pulls away and strips off his clothes, gyrating theatrically and flinging his pants across the room to try and make her look up. Rory keeps her eyes firmly on the book, but when he rips off his shorts and wiggles his hips right by her face, he's rewarded by the ghost of a smile.
    
    "There's a naked man in your room!" Dean raises his hands in mock horror. "Aren't you going to protect your maidenly honor?"
    
    "That ship has sailed," Rory says wryly. "But I may be moved to strong measures to protect my maidenly reading privileges." Her voice goes high and breathy on the last word as Dean licks a long stripe along her neck, though, and when he slides his hand between her legs she shifts them wider.
    
    Dean rubs his thumb along the crease where her thigh meets her ass, sliding lower and lower till he can feel the heat of her. He holds his hand there, heavy and unmoving, and says regretfully to the room, "Nothing I can do that can compete with a book."
    
    "It's sadly true," Rory says, but she's definitely smiling now, and she hasn't turned a page for at least two minutes.
    
    Dean nibbles gently at her ear and slides his hand a little further, just the tip of his thumb nudging her wetness. When she moans and shifts back into him Dean rolls closer, pressing his cock into the warmth of her leg. He kisses along her spine, grinning against her skin as her breath starts to come faster. He waits until she tenses, about to turn to kiss him, and pulls away.
    
    "Guess I'll just have to amuse myself," he says mournfully.
    
    Rory laughs and bats his hand away from his cock, little hands wrapping around him. Dean barely suppresses his moan when he feels her mouth join them.
    
    Half an hour later, they're both flushed and panting, lying sticky and boneless in a tumble of sheets.
    
    "Jesus Christ," Dean breathes. "Where do you learn these things?"
    
    Rory smirks and kisses him. "I get them out of books."

    Jared's a morning person.
    
    He loves the way every morning is like a brand new start - the way the day stretches out ahead of him, filled with promise. When he's up before the sun, the world seems to hold its breath, and anything feels possible.
    
    It's just as well Jared's a morning person, because Jensen really, really isn't.
    
    Jared slips carefully out from under Jensen's arm and quietly pulls on his clothes. It's Sunday, so he could afford to sleep in later, but after a hard week of shooting his body-clock is still wired to wake him up early, and he knows better than to try to go back to sleep.
    
    One of the good things about Jensen not being a morning person, though, is that Jared can kiss him goodbye without worrying about waking him. At this hour on a Sunday morning, Jensen is dead to the world, and it takes a lot more than Jared's lips grazing the corner of his mouth to wake him. Today, Jensen just sighs softly and buries deeper into his blankets.
    
    Jared smiles and slips out of Jensen's apartment.
    
    He has to be a morning person, really. He has two dogs which need to be walked, and with the schedule he keeps, early morning before the sun rises is the only real opportunity. He jogs through the streets with them, enjoying the peace, the way the pavements belong to him alone and no one is there to even notice him, let alone recognise him.
    
    Back at his apartment, he takes a long shower, enjoying the heat of the water against his skin and humming softly under his breath: some tune that's worked its way into his head, though he can't place it or think of the words. He might ask Jensen later, if it starts to bug him, but for now he's happy just to hum along and not think about it too much. He takes his time, shampoos his hair twice. It's Sunday, and Jensen won't be wanting to get up for hours yet. Jared's got plenty of time.
    
    The dogs are waiting for him when he finally emerges from the shower, so he wraps a towel around his waist and pads barefoot out to the kitchen to feed them, leaving damp footprints for a few steps on the hallway carpet. Once the dogs are satisfied, he towels off in his bedroom and hunts out some clean clothes to throw on. He could do to do some laundry, but it's Sunday and he doesn't want to waste his time on that, even if he won't have a chance to do any during the week.
    
    His hair's all damp and sticking up oddly, he notices as he passes a mirror on his way to the door. He runs a hand over it self-consciously, but decides against backtracking to find a comb. It'll probably just get messed up more when he goes outside, anyway, and it's not like he's going to meet anyone he knows at this time of day.
    
    The sun's coming up properly as Jared walks along the street. The grey colourlessness of the hour before dawn is giving way to faint gold and pink. Sometimes early mornings can fool you, but it looks like it's going to be a beautiful day.
    
    The shop on the corner of the street is opening, and Jared ducks in just long enough to buy syrup and flour: he's got a craving for pancakes, suddenly, his belly rumbling its demands. The woman behind the counter doesn't bat an eye at his hair, even though he's sure it's drying all weird, but he guesses she gets far weirder types, or maybe she's just happy to have any sale this early. He grins at her, either way, and drops his change into the charity collection box as he leaves.
    
    His key turns quietly in the lock, and he cocks his head to listen as he shuts the door behind him. The apartment is still silent, and he grins and dumps his bag of groceries in the kitchen, then kicks off his shoes and wanders through to the bedroom.
    
    Jensen's still where he left him, though he's kicked off one layer of blankets now, and Jared drinks in the sight of Jensen's exposed back, the line of his shoulder blade from where Jensen's got one arm flung out across the empty half of the bed. Jared wants to kiss his way down that shoulder blade, but Jensen looks so comfortable and peaceful that Jared doesn't want to wake him. Jensen doesn't get as much sleep as he needs, usually.
    
    Jared reached out for the top blanket and tugs it gently back up over Jensen, but he messes up somehow, because Jensen makes a sleepy, inquisitive sound and half-blinks his eyes open.
    
    "Hey," Jared murmurs. "Go back to sleep, I didn't mean to wake you, man."
    
    He's not sure Jensen is quite tracking yet, and his suspicion is confirmed when Jensen stretches out one hand for him, open and easy in a way he wouldn't be if he was fully awake. Jared can't resist that, leaning down with one knee balanced on the bed to kiss Jensen softly.
    
    "C'mon back to bed," Jensen murmurs sleepily when they separate, and pulls him down properly. "Way too early to get up." He shifts and tugs at the covers, and suddenly Jared finds himself enveloped in warm blankets and Jensen. Jensen's alreadly curling up against him, his eyes closed, and Jared doesn't really want to disturb him, so he turns his face into Jensen's hair and lets his eyes slip shut.
    
    Jared's a morning person, and Jensen's really not. But on days like this, Jared think that works out pretty well.

  summary: 
  content: |-
    Sam Winchester always felt that the common misconception that his brother just didn't get possessed was rather unfair. True, the really bad shit did seem to bypass him and head straight for Sam, which was something of a bitch. But Sam had slowly developed the theory that Dean's amulet protected him from Full-On Evil, but at the price of drawing all kinds of Fucked-Up Weirdness straight to him. There was just no other explanation for the things that happened to Dean.
    
    Of course, no one knew about those things, because they all got filed immediately under the heading of "Not To Be Discussed Ever Again Under Any Circumstances, I'm Not Even Fucking Kidding Here, Sammy, This Never Happened, Got That?".
    
    Still, Sam did have some truly awesome photographic evidence if he ever decided he really needed to blackmail his brother for some reason.
    
    <u><i>One</i></u>
    
    When Sam was shaken awake in the middle of the night to find a mime standing over him, he actually screamed.
    
    In retrospect, he should have seen it coming. He and Dean were in the midst of another escalating prank war, and he'd got Dean pretty good in that bar the day before. He'd been expecting Dean to come up with something fiendishly creative, and he'd made a point of checking his bed out very cautiously before going to sleep that night. He should have known that Dean was just waiting until Sam let his guard down.
    
    Still, a mime? Who could be expected to see <em>that</em> coming?
    
    Dean was dressed in a ridiculous black-and-white clown outfit, his face covered in white face-paint, dark crosses marked over his eyes. He was possibly the most surreal thing Sam had ever seen, and considering the nature of their family business, that was saying something.
    
    He was laughing silently at the expression on Sam's face, almost doubled over with the force of it.
    
    "<em>Jesus</em>, Dean," Sam said, trying to bring his heart rate back under control. "You complete <em>asshole</em>!"
    
    Dean was still laughing, his entire body shaking.
    
    The fact that he was doing so silently was weird, though. Sam somehow doubted it was out of consideration for the people in the motel room next door.
    
    "Your mind is seriously twisted, dude," Sam grumbled, lying back down. "<em>Twisted</em>. Fuck off and let me go back to sleep. You are so going down for this one."
    
    Dean had stopped laughing and was now shaking his head wildly.
    
    Sam rolled his eyes and turned onto his side. "I mean it, Dean. Payback can wait until the morning."
    
    Dean moved around so that he was in Sam's line of sight and shook his head again, his expression now mildly panicked. He placed one hand deliberately across his mouth, then the other on top of it, and shook his head again, eyeing Sam meaningfully.
    
    Sam stared. "Dude, what the fuck?"
    
    It was Dean's turn to roll his eyes. He repeated the same actions slowly, placing both hands over his mouth and shaking his head. Then he gestured at his clown outfit and spread his arms in a helpless gesture.
    
    "You have got to be kidding me," Sam said sceptically. "You had your joke, Dean, I screamed like a girl, I get it, okay? This part is totally weak by comparison."
    
    Dean shook his head again and mouthed as if trying to shout, then clapped both hands over his mouth again.
    
    "You're kidding," Sam said. "You are totally not trying to tell me you actually can't talk, Dean."
    
    His brother waved one hand in a <em>finally</em> gesture, and nodded emphatically.
    
    Sam waited a moment for Dean to start laughing, then took a deep breath when he didn't. "You're serious."
    
    Dean rolled his eyes again, but nodded.
    
    Sam slowly sat up again and leaned against the headboard. "Oooooooookay. What the hell happened?"
    
    Dean glared at him meaningfully, but launched into a rapid series of mimes.
    
    Sam stared, openmouthed, and interrupted after a couple of minutes. "Dude, I'm not getting any of this. Start again."
    
    His brother glared harder, but began again, pointing at Sam and then placing both hands at the side of his face, tilting his head slightly and closing his eyes.
    
    "I was asleep," Sam said, guessing aloud. "Or you waited until I was asleep to pull this stunt?"
    
    Dean nodded firmly and continued, miming something very complicated that Sam took as meaning "payback for that prank in the bar the other day, you little bitch". He wrinkled his face in a puzzled expression, then mimed a light bulb going on above his head, then pointed at Sam, at his outfit, and mimed screaming.
    
    "Nice," Sam observed drily.
    
    Dean grinned broadly, then sobered again. He placed one hand above his eyes and peered around the room as if searching for something, then gestured at the outfit again, then pointed at himself and gave a thumbs-up sign. He mimed pulling on clothes, mouthing words soundlessly all the while, then clapped his hands over his mouth again, before spreading his hands helplessly.
    
    "I don't believe this," Sam said, shaking his head in disbelief. "You're being possessed by a <em>mime outfit</em>?"
    
    Dean shrugged, looking vaguely embarrassed.
    
    Sam stared at him for a moment longer, and then cracked up.
    
    It turned out that Dean could mime "fuck you" very effectively.
    
    ***
    
    "Sounds like..." Sam frowned. "Cake?"
    
    Dean nodded, and gave the "keep going" gesture.
    
    Sam thought about it, then suddenly sat up. "Lake! Spirit Lake? We drove through there a couple of days ago, didn't we? So that's where you bought the outfit?"
    
    Dean gave a relieved-looking nod and sank down into a chair.
    
    "I can't believe we're trying to solve a case using <em>charades</em>, man," Sam said, starting to laugh. "This is so fucked up."
    
    The response was a rapid series of mimes amounting to "You're telling <em>me</em>?" But Dean's mouth was twitching too, underneath all the make-up.
    
    They had experimented and discovered that Dean was restricted to mimes and gestures. He couldn't write or talk. The most amusing part, from Sam's perspective, was that his brother <em>had</em> to mime a response to a direct question, whether he wanted to or not. Sam wasn't entirely sure whether to be slightly freaked out or hugely amused by his brother's newfound miming skills, but he was taking a fiendish pleasure in asking Dean awkward questions just to see the mimed response. Dean's rendition of "I'm going to the bathroom to take a piss, QUIT ASKING ME FUCKING QUESTIONS, SAMMY" had left Sam in hysterics.
    
    The costume couldn't be removed. The make-up refused to come off, even when they had tried using holy water. They had concluded, after much talking (on Sam's part) and gesturing (on Dean's part), that their only option was to return to where Dean had bought the costume and investigate why it might possibly be possessing him. Of course, that plan was dependent on Dean managing to communicate where that had been.
    
    At least they'd narrowed it down to the town, Sam thought with relief. Dean would be able to point out the shop when they got there. Another round of charades to try to figure out the name of the shop was a bit more than he was feeling able to cope with right then.
    
    "Okay," Sam said, "let's get moving. Gimme the keys."
    
    <em>Like hell</em>, Dean mimed.
    
    "Fine," Sam said, grinning. "You can be the one to explain to the police officer who stops us that you're not drunk or anything, you're just possessed. Through the medium of mime."
    
    Dean glared daggers at him, and threw him the keys.
    
    Sam hummed happily all the way to the car.
    
    ***
    
    "Feel any more talkative yet?"
    
    The cause had proven to be fairly easy to pinpoint, after all; a mime artist had killed himself in Spirit Lake several years previously, leaving a suicide note complaining about how hard his life was, and how underappreciated mime artists were. The costume Dean had purchased had belonged to him. It had been a simple matter at that point to find the grave, and they were already at the salt-and-burn part of the evening.
    
    Unfortunately, it did not appear to be having any effect.
    
    "Maybe it's the costume that needs to be destroyed," Sam mused aloud. "Though since we can't get it off you, that'd be a bit tricky."
    
    Dean mimed what he'd do to Sam if his brother tried to set his outfit alight while he was still wearing it.
    
    Sam grimaced, then frowned suddenly as an idea struck him. "Hey, Dean. Why don't you try miming salting and burning his bones?"
    
    Dean stared at him as though Sam had gone mad.
    
    Sam shrugged. "Well. It's got to be worth a try, right?"
    
    One eyebrow arched sardonically, but Dean sighed and shrugged and did so, miming opening the container of gasoline and pouring it over the bones, despite the fact that they were already burning merrily, then pretended to shake salt over them, flicked open an imaginary lighter, lit an imaginary twig, and threw it onto the blazing bones.
    
    "- No way in hell this is going to - <em>hey</em>!" Dean beamed. "What the <em>fuck</em>, dude."
    
    Sam started laughing.
    
    Dean stripped hastily out of the mime outfit and threw it onto the flames, then snagged a bottle of holy water from their supplies and tried washing his face. The make-up came off this time.
    
    They tacitly agreed that Sam had won that prank war. And called a truce. For at least a couple of hundred miles.
    
    
    <em><u>Two</u></em>
    
    
    Sam had wondered what the hell was going on when his brother didn't return after an hour. After three hours, Sam figured he must have been kidding about going for a swim and had actually slipped off to the nearest bar. Or possibly the bed of the nearest waitress.
    
    Four hours after Dean had left for a quick dip to cool off, Sam went out to find something to eat. The path led past the motel's swimming pool, and Sam slowed and then stopped at the realisation that someone actually was swimming.
    
    It was Dean, although he looked exhausted and entirely lacking in his usual grace in the water.
    
    "Dean?" Sam called, incredulous. "Have you been out here swimming all this time? It's been hours, dude, I thought you wanted to go grab something to eat?"
    
    "Sam!" Dean gasped, his voice filled with relief. He didn't pause in his swimming; he was currently doing the breast-stroke, talking every time he surfaced. "Sammy, am I glad to see you -" He ducked underwater for another stroke and resurfaced. "You gotta help me, man, I can't stop -" Another stroke. "Think the pool's possessed or something..." He reached the end of the pool and performed a neat underwater turn before resurfacing. "I have to do eight lengths per stroke, and breast-stroke..." Underwater, resurface. "Only one I can talk during. Dude, you gotta help me, I don't know -" Underwater, resurface. "- How much longer I can keep going like this."
    
    If Dean hadn't looked so utterly exhausted, Sam would have thought he was joking. As it was, he called back "I'm going to fetch the laptop," and sprinted for the motel room.
    
    He returned to the pool side with the laptop a few minutes later to find Dean performing the butterfly stroke. Sam knew damn well that Dean had never voluntarily used that stroke in his life; one swimming coach had tried to make him, but Dean had insisted it was like violently drowning yourself, and really there were better ways to go.
    
    That settled it. Dean really was possessed.
    
    Sam rolled his eyes. How the hell did Dean even get himself into these situations?
    
    By the time Dean had completed his lengths using the butterfly stroke, front crawl and back crawl and returned to the relatively communication-friendly breast-stroke, Sam had managed to zip through a lot of research.
    
    "Okay, so you remember when the motel owner said the pool wasn't safe?" Sam asked rhetorically, and waited for Dean to dip underwater and resurface before continuing. "Three people have died here in the past year. All good swimmers, but drowned in the pool." Another pause for Dean to resurface. "The first seems to be the one causing the problem - high school student who hoped to make the swim team, undiagnosed heart problem, pushed himself too hard while practising and died."
    
    "Dude," Dean gasped out, "just tell me you know how to stop it."
    
    "Oh, right," Sam said, and started thinking.
    
    Dean groaned and shifted back to his drowning-not-waving butterfly stroke.
    
    The problem was, the high school kid had been cremated, Sam noted. Which... well, which left the pool itself. Right?
    
    He ended up pouring their entire stock of holy water into the pool water and performing a hasty banishing ritual.
    
    He knew it worked when Dean suddenly went under like a stone in mid-butterfly, choking and spluttering.
    
    Sam hauled him out, and Dean lay on the ground next to the pool, gasping for air.
    
    "You really need to work on your butterfly, man," Sam said eventually. "That was pretty weak."
    
    As it turned out, Dean didn't even have enough energy left to give him the finger.
    
    
    <u><i>Three</i></u>
    
    Sam had always had a slight terror of the pop star Shakira, ever since he'd seen one of her videos for the first time.
    
    He suspected that non-Winchesters, on seeing one of her videos for the first time, would probably be slack-jawed that any human body could move like that. And then most men would move straight on to thinking "Whoa, hot." Sam, however, was a Winchester, and he reached a different conclusion:
    
    Shakira's breasts were clearly possessed.
    
    Possibly not just her breasts, although the evidence for that was the most clear-cut. He'd watched several of her videos obsessively and finally concluded that no, he was not paranoid, her stomach was possessed as well. Which implied that perhaps her entire body was, and it was just manifested most obviously in those two locations.
    
    Jess had hit him upside the head and told him to stop ogling.
    
    Sam had protested that injustice, but had found it difficult to offer any alternative explanation for his behaviour. He had a feeling Jess wouldn't buy "I think Shakira's breasts are possessed" as an excuse.
    
    Now, however, Sam was feeling completely and utterly vindicated, because whatever kind of thing it was possessing Shakira, the same type of thing had now taken over his brother's body.
    
    The breast-dancing thing didn't work quite as well on Dean, since he didn't really have what could be termed a... (Sam groped - no, searched - for a suitable term) bustline. The stomach thing, though... Jesus. Sam had had no idea his brother could <em>move</em> like that. Or perhaps "writhe" would be a more accurate term.
    
    When Dean had unexpectedly hit the dance floor, Sam had at first assumed that Dean was both very, very drunk and being more of an exhibitionist than usual. Plenty of women, and not a few men, had soon gravitated towards him.
    
    But then a few alarm bells had started ringing in Sam's head, because he was pretty sure that no matter how much his brother had had to drink, he would not be dancing to <em>Shakira</em> if he was in his right mind.
    
    And then Dean had started <em>writhing</em>, and Sam had realised he was possessed.
    
    He had come up with a few theories while studying Shakira's videos, back before Jess had finally put her foot down about the whole thing. It had to be some kind of creature that thrived on the attention and the sexual energy it drew from its audience. Possibly some weird kind of Colombian succubus. He'd come up with a cunning plan to bluff his way backstage during a concert and investigate in more detail, but it was around about that point that Jess had put her foot down. Very firmly.
    
    Since he'd been back on the road with Dean, he'd almost forgotten about the possessed pop star. Dean would sooner have died than let Shakira's music be played in his car, no matter how much Sam had suspected Dean would appreciate her brand of dancing.
    
    He'd thought Dean would appreciate watching it. He'd never dreamed he would end up watching Dean dancing that way himself.
    
    Dean leaned unnaturally far back and Sam stared, openmouthed, as his stomach muscles rippled.
    
    Sam took a moment to consider his strategy. Obviously, what he <em>ought</em> to do was figure out a way to free Dean from whatever kind of weird Shakira-related thing was possessing him.
    
    Obviously, what he was <em>going</em> to do was dig the video camera out of their bag at his feet and start recording.
    
    Well, there was always the chance that it could be a ghost instead, after all. And Sam had always believed in being thorough in his research.
    
    Potential blackmail material... Well, that was just a bonus.

  summary: 
  content: |
    Jared doesn't think there's anything <em>wrong</em> about him having a bit of a crush on Dean Winchester.
    
    He figures it's pretty much understandable. Maybe even to be expected. After all, Dean looks almost exactly like Jensen, only cockier, with harder edges and a razor-sharp grin. What's more, Jared knows Dean, has spent so much time in-character with him that he practically considers him a real person now, someone who cracks him up and infuriates him and just makes him <em>feel</em> at a level way deeper than he'd ever imagined a fictional character could. And when someone calls "Cut!", Dean shoots him a grin that says he knows <em>exactly </em>what he's doing to Jared before melting back into Jensen, smiling softer but with a wicked gleam in his eyes, and some days Jared isn't sure he can wait until they get back to their trailers before he jumps his co-star.
    
    But though he doesn't think his crush on Dean is <em>wrong</em>, he does occasionally worry that Jensen might take it the wrong way, figure that he's just a stand-in for his alter-ego or something equally ridiculous, especially since Jensen's been suffering from character bleed on and off this season. So Jared tries to keep his crush under control: tries not to jump Jensen while he's still wearing Dean's clothes, tries to stop himself from smiling stupidly when he hears music playing that he knows Dean would love, tries not to get too turned on while watching Dean from the sidelines when he has a scene without Sam.
    
    Not that that's always easy. Especially when Dean's chanting in Latin, voice cold and strong as he paces around the female demon, the unfamiliar words on Dean's lips going straight to Jared's cock, and he has to melt away into the darkness once the incantation's over so he can take care of his problem before Jensen returns, shucking off Dean's voice along with his jacket.
    
    Yeah, refraining from jerking off while thinking about Dean is another thing Jared needs to work on.
    
    He suspects that Jensen might have an inkling about his crush, but he's seemed more vaguely amused than pissed so far, and Jared's really hoping he managed to pass off the incident in Jensen's trailer the other week as him simply finding Jensen really, really hot in a leather jacket throwing knives at his dart board. Because, well, Jensen <em>was </em>really, really hot like that. The fact that it had been like walking in to find Dean occupying his co-star's trailer had nothing to do with it. Really.
    
    Shit, he is in so much trouble.
    
    And while he doesn't think it's <em>wrong</em>, it does feel just close enough to being unfaithful to make him uneasy. Which is screwed up, because having a crush on a character played by your significant other can hardly count as cheating, can it? And it's not like it could ever go anywhere, what with Dean not really <em>existing </em>outside their heads. So there's no call to freak out about it. Especially considering how understandable it is. Dean is fucking hot, that's all there is to it. So is Jensen. It's all good.
    
    Except Jared really is kind of freaking out a bit. And when Jensen <em>almost </em>walks into Jared's trailer one evening while Jared's jerking off in the shower with Dean's name on his lips, Jared panics and takes himself off to a bar to get very, very drunk just as soon as he's managed to towel off and shrug on some clothes.
    
    It's a good bar for angsting in. Jared hardly ever comes here; he likes bright places with happy people, where he can laugh and joke and hang out with his friends. This bar is dimly lit and near-deserted, but at least he can be assured of anonymity while he tries to drink himself into oblivion. He stares moodily down at his bottle of beer, peeling the label away in shreds.
    
    The jukebox starts playing Metallica, and Jared laughs bitterly under his breath. He's not drunk enough for this shit.
    
    "This seat taken?"
    
    Jared's head snaps up so fast he almost gets whiplash, because he <em>knows</em> that voice.
    
    Dean doesn't bother to wait for permission, which is just as well, since Jared isn't sure he could say a word out right now. This is Dean in front of him, not Jensen; they look very alike, but not quite identical, and Jared can tell the difference immediately, recognises the assessing look in Dean's eyes as he settles down opposite him, the faint smirk as he takes in Jared's slack-jawed expression, the slight tilt to his head that says <b><em>oh </b>yeah</em>.
    
    Jared just stares for a long moment, taking in Dean's leather jacket, the amulet against his chest, the bracelet twined around his wrist, the ring clinking against the beer bottle. Dean's eyes have the same intensity that keeps him hooked when he's playing Sam, but he's never had that intensity directed at him as <em>Jared </em>before, and in two seconds flat he's gone from angsting to so turned on it hurts.
    
    For a stupid moment he feels he should... say something, ask Jensen what he's doing, if this is okay, if he's sure, but Dean raises his beer bottle to his lips and tilts his head back, and the motion of his throat as he swallows drives everything else out of Jared's mind.
    
    "So," Dean says, setting his beer down with a <em>clink</em>, eyes still gazing intently at Jared. "That beer do somethin' to piss you off? The way you were glaring at it just now, I figured maybe I should step in."
    
    Jared can't help but laugh. "What, protect me from the beer bottle?"
    
    "Nah," Dean says dismissively. "You look like you could take it." His eyes sweep appreciatively down Jared's body, and Jared feels his heart speed up. "But I figured the beer bottle might need protecting from you. It's pretty defenceless." He reaches out and takes it from Jared's grasp, his fingers trailing across the backs of Jared's hands for a moment before he pulls back and lifts the bottle to his mouth.
    
    Jared stares at those lips wrapped around the bottle he had been drinking from himself just a few minutes before, and tries not to whimper.
    
    "You got a name?" Dean asks, lowering Jared's beer, fingers grazing absently over the shredded label.
    
    Jared manages to pull himself together enough to reply, even if he is almost too turned on to think. "Jared."
    
    Dean nods in response. "Dean." The faint smile playing at his lips tells Jared that his reactions are not going unnoticed. "So, Jared, you play pool?"
    
    It takes Jared a moment to drag his mind away from <em>musthavesexnow </em>to the concept of playing pool. "Uh, yeah. You want a game?"
    
    Dean's smile is wicked. "Bring it on. And bring your beer, too. But treat it right this time." He shoves the bottle and it skates back across the table to Jared, who catches it without looking away from Dean's gaze. Dean pushes to his feet and heads over towards the pool tables.
    
    Jared watches the unconscious grace of Dean's movements, then raises the bottle to his lips and takes a sip, feeling it burn against his lips like a kiss, before he follows.
    
    He finds it difficult to concentrate on the game, unsurprisingly. Normally, Jared's pretty good at pool, but Dean is better than him - better than Jensen, for that matter, and that kind of breaks Jared's brain if he thinks about it too much, so he doesn't. Fortunately, it's easy to distract himself, because Dean playing pool is one giant distraction. Jared figures he's got it down to a fine art, since normally he's hustling for money. Everything he does - bending over the pool table, shirt hitching up to reveal his lower back; leaning casually against the bar, fingers absently stroking along the pool cue cradled in his hands; prowling around the table as Jared bends over to take his shot, green eyes like a weight on Jared's back - is driving Jared crazy, and he's pretty sure he's never lost a game of pool this badly in his life. Not that he gives a damn. 
    
    Dean grins at him, because they both know he's won. He sinks the last few balls confidently, then straightens, and the heat in his eyes makes Jared swallow hard.
    
    "Good game," Jared says, because he's not entirely sure how Dean would react to 'Can we have sex now?'
    
    Dean grins slowly. "Do I win a prize?" He sets the pool cue down and stalks slowly around the table towards Jared.
    
    
    
    Jared puts down his own cue and takes a deep breath, before suddenly realising: this is <em>Dean</em>. Why exactly is he worrying about Dean's reaction to being hit on?
    
    "Yeah," Jared says, his voice sounding rough to his own ears. "I think you do."
    
    Heat flashes in Dean's eyes and he reaches out to grab his jacket without breaking eye contact. "Then how about we get outta here?"
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Jared's so far gone that when they walk out of the bar and he sees the Impala waiting, he doesn't even think to question it until they're halfway back to his apartment. After a moment, though, he shrugs off his surprise. It was pretty obvious already that Jensen's put some thought into this. When it comes to acting, he's a perfectionist.
    
    "Straight ahead?" Dean asks, interrupting as if he knows Jared's over-thinking now.
    
    "Uh, no, left at the crossroads," Jared says, and stops thinking.
    
    The parking garage beneath Jared's apartment building is dimly lit and dingy, lights crackling overhead. Dean barely has time to park the Impala before Jared is on him.
    
    There's not enough room for Jared to crawl into Dean's lap comfortably, but he does his best, pressing Dean back against the seat, feeling the steering wheel jam into his spine. Dean is making pleased noises and kissing him back, those goddamn lips that drive Jared crazy at the best of times now hot and demanding against his own.
    
    Dean kisses differently to Jensen. Kissing Jensen is soft and warm and like falling, and Jared never wants to stop. Dean's kiss is hungry, demanding, as hot and ruthless as his knife-throwing, and Jared thinks that if they keep it up too long he might pass out.
    
    He tries to press closer, but there really is no room, and the steering wheel is definitely doing its best to thwart him.
    
    Dean pulls away, laughing low and dirty. "I like the way you think, but why don't we take this someplace I can strip those jeans off you?"
    
    Jared is out of the car and tugging Dean towards the elevator faster than he would have thought humanly possible.
    
    Inside the elevator, Dean shoves Jared up against the mirrored wall and tugs his head down for another kiss. Jared moans and pulls him closer, slipping one hand beneath the turned-up collar of that damnable leather jacket, running his fingers along the nape of Dean's neck, curling his hand around the knot of the cord on which Dean's amulet hangs. Dean almost <em>growls</em>, and Jared is giving serious thought to hitting the emergency stop button and just fucking up against the elevator wall when the doors spring open with a <em>ding</em>.
    
    They stumble down the corridor to the apartment door. Jared fumbles with his keys, his hands shaking, and Dean doesn't help, pressed up tight behind him, mouth hot against his neck. Jared moans, half in arousal, half in frustration, and then <em>thank god </em>the door opens and he stumbles inside. Dean moves with him, and Jared slams the door closed and then slams Dean up against it.
    
    Dean seems to have no problem with being manhandled; he leans up, face tilting to meet Jared's lips as they close on his. Jared pushes at Dean's jacket, and Dean shoves away from the wall, pressing into Jared to give himself room to shrug it off. Jared starts working on the buttons of Dean's shirt, then moans into his mouth as he feels Dean's hands slip beneath his shirt and t-shirt to slide up his back, fingernails grazing just hard enough to make him shudder.
    
    Jared breaks the kiss so that he can trace the line of Dean's jaw with his mouth, savouring the texture of Dean's stubble against his lips. Dean throws his head back with a groan, an irresistible invitation for Jared to nip his way down his neck, sucking hard as he feels Dean's hands start working on the buckle of his belt, and that's it, Jared can't even think any more. Everything descends into a blurred flurry of movement as they scramble out of their own clothes and tug off each other's.
    
    They stumble blindly through Jared's apartment, tripping over furniture because they can't stop kissing, can't stop touching, can't pull away long enough to look where they're going. Jared hears something topple over and the shatter of breaking glass, but he couldn't give a damn. They reach the door to Jared's bedroom and Dean presses him up hard against the doorframe, sucking at his throat, pushing a thigh between Jared's legs and against his cock. Jared moans helplessly and can't stop himself from rocking against Dean's thigh; it's a minute before he can think clearly enough to put his hands on Dean's chest to shove him back, into the room and onto the bed.
    
    They roll together, pressing and pulling, gasping for air and kissing like they can't stop. There's no thinking now, just heat. Dean's amulet grazes along Jared's chest as they kiss, then brushes against his nipple, and Jared breaks the kiss, throwing his head back and moaning desperately. Dean grins at him and starts working his way down Jared's body, mouth and amulet blazing winding, interlocking trails that make Jared's stomach muscles jump. Then Dean is tugging down Jared's boxers and wrapping warm fingers around his cock.
    
    Jared's not quiet at the best of times, and especially not during sex, but he doesn't think he's ever been this out of control. He cries out and mentally thanks god for the fact that his apartment has good soundproofing, for the fact that he has such an awesome lover, for the fact that Dean's mouth is now closing around his cock. Normally he would try to be considerate when someone is going down on him, but he's long past being able to control his body's response to Dean, and he can't stop himself from thrusting up hard into his mouth. But then Dean's hands close firmly on his hips, holding him down, controlling him, and Jared thinks he might just come from that alone.
    
    Dean pulls off him for a moment, and Jared can't hold back a whimper. "Lube?" Dean asks, his voice low and sex-roughened.
    
    "Top drawer," Jared chokes out, his own voice shot to hell.
    
    He lies still and tries to catch his breath while Dean leans over to fish around in the drawer, settling back a moment later with lube and a condom. Then a slick finger pushes against Jared, circling, then into him, as straightforward and intense as Dean himself. Before Jared can do more than moan, Dean's mouth is hot around his cock again, and Jared's brain short-circuits into <em>need</em> and <em>now</em> and <em>ohgoddon'tstop</em>.
    
    He's close, so close, and when Dean pulls off him again he damn-near sobs. Dean's hands are shaking as they stroke his thighs reassuringly and push his legs up. Then Dean thrusts into him, unhesitating and uncompromising, and Jared arches his back and cries out. It's good, so fucking good, and hurts just enough for him not to come instantly, pulling him back from the brink.
    
    Dean braces himself with his hands on either side of Jared's face and begins to move. The pace he sets is a little rougher and faster than Jensen would, and Jared pushes up to meet him, encouraging him to lose control. He reaches up to touch Dean's amulet and then the taut planes of Dean's face, before tangling his hand in Dean's hair and pulling him down for a kiss. Dean's amulet grazes along his chest again, and Jared moans into his mouth.
    
    Dean wraps a hand around Jared's cock. Jared almost wants to stop him, because he doesn't want to come, doesn't want to leave this moment. But Dean's thrusts inside him are becoming jerkier, slowly starting to lose their rhythm as he gets close. He's hitting <em>that </em>spot, his hand working Jared's cock, his green eyes holding Jared's gaze: it's all too much, and suddenly Jared is almost screaming as he comes. A few more erratic thrusts and Dean follows him, mouth working soundlessly, before he collapses on top of Jared.
    
    It's a long moment before either of them can move, but eventually Dean presses a kiss to Jared's chest and pulls out of him. Jared is almost asleep already, utterly boneless and satiated. He's only vaguely aware of Dean cleaning them both up and climbing back into bed, but he remains conscious just long enough to curl himself around Dean. He's asleep before Dean can voice any complaint about the snuggling.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Jared wakes up the next morning to find Jensen curled up in his arms, warm and smiling, blinking up at him sleepily.
    
    "You," Jared starts, then shakes his head, because for once in his life he is just about speechless. "<em>Jesus</em>, Jensen."
    
    Jensen's smile widens into a grin, and he tugs Jared down for a kiss.
    
    "You're welcome," he says when their lips finally part, quite some time later. "Think you're done angsting about it, now?"
    
    Jared stares at him. "Holy shit, Jensen." Yeah, the angsting is pretty much <em>forgotten</em> in favour of wondering whether Jensen would maybe be willing to do this again sometime. Hell, role-playing is what they <em>do</em>, right? Suddenly Jared can't remember why he was worried about this whole thing in the first place.
    
    Jensen chuckles lazily, and pulls Jared back down on top of him. "Glad you liked."
    
    "'Liked'," Jared murmurs incredulously, going with him willingly and resting his head on Jensen's chest. "Jesus."
    
    Jensen's heart beats steadily beneath him, and Jared has almost let it lull him back to sleep when he hears Jensen's voice murmur in his ear.
    
    "'Sides, maybe if I'm lucky you'll return the favour some day."

    [002] Ended the king's long story, with which all seemed to be very well pleased, quoth Dioneo with a laugh: \"The good man that looked that night to cause the bogey's tail to droop, would scarce have contributed two pennyworth of all the praise you bestow on Messer Torello:\" then, witting that it now only remained for him to tell, thus he began:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [003] Gentle my ladies, this day, meseems, is dedicate to Kings and Soldans and folk of the like quality; wherefore, that I stray not too far from you, I am minded to tell you somewhat of a Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but a piece of mad folly, albeit there came good thereof to him in the end. The which I counsel none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it turned out well with him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [004] There was in olden days a certain Marquis of Saluzzo, Gualtieri by name, a young man, but head of the house, who, having neither wife nor child, passed his time in nought else but in hawking and hunting, and of taking a wife and begetting children had no thought; wherein he should have been accounted very wise: [005] but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes entreat him to take a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and they be left without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern, and of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be well content with the sequel. [006] To whom: \"My friends,\" replied Gualtieri, \"you enforce me to that which I had resolved never to do, seeing how hard it is to find a wife, whose ways accord well with one's own, and how plentiful is the supply of such as run counter thereto, and how grievous a life he leads who chances upon a lady that matches ill with him. [007] And to say that you think to know the daughters by the qualities of their fathers and mothers, and thereby--so you would argue--to provide me with a wife to my liking, is but folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate the secrets of their mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted that you do know them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their parents. [008] However, as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am content that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but myself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of my own choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom I choose, if she receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you shall prove to your great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained by your importunity to take a wife against my will.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    The worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he would marry without more ado. [009] And Gualtieri, who had long noted with approval the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by his house, and found her fair enough, deemed that with her he might pass a tolerably happy life. Wherefore he sought no further, but forthwith resolved to marry her; and having sent for her father, who was a very poor man, he contracted with him to take her to wife. [010] Which done, Gualtieri assembled all the friends he had in those parts, and: \"My friends,\" quoth he, \"you were and are minded that I should take a wife, and rather to comply with your wishes, than for any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my mind to do so. [011] You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that, whomsoever I should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady. Which promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am to keep mine. [012] I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own heart, whom I purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my house in the course of a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how you may make the nuptial feast splendid, and welcome her with all honour; that I may confess myself satisfied with your observance of your promise, as you will be with my observance of mine.\"[013] The worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity that they were well content, and that, whoever she might be, they would entreat her as a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which, they all addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration of the event, as did also Gualtieri. [014] He arranged for a wedding most stately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and kinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood; and therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and fashioned to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions as the girl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store, besides, of girdles and rings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and all the other paraphernalia of a bride.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [015] The day that he had appointed for the wedding being come, about half tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to do him honour, and having made all needful dispositions: \"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"'tis time to go bring home the bride.\" And so away he rode with his company to the village; [016] where, being come to the house of the girl's father, they found her returning from the spring with a bucket of water, making all the haste she could, that she might afterwards go with the other women to see Gualtieri's bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called her by her name, to wit, Griselda, and asked her where her father was. To whom she modestly made answer: \"My lord, he is in the house.\"[017] Whereupon Gualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await him without, entered the cottage alone; and meeting her father, whose name was Giannucolo: \"I am come,\" quoth he, \"to wed Griselda, but first of all there are some matters I would learn from her own lips in thy presence.\"[018] He then asked her, whether, if he took her to wife, she would study to comply with his wishes, and be not wroth, no matter what he might say or do, and be obedient, with not a few other questions of a like sort: to all which she answered, ay. [019] Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led her forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other folk as were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the garments that he had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith arrayed therein, and upon her unkempt head let set a crown; [020] and then, while all wondered: \"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"this is she whom I purpose to make my wife, so she be minded to have me for husband.\" Then, she standing abashed and astonied, he turned to her, saying: \"Griselda, wilt thou have me for thy husband?\"[021] To whom: \"Ay, my lord,\" answered she. [022] \"And I will have thee to wife,\" said he, and married her before them all. And having set her upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [023] The wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter of the King of France, the feast could not have been more splendid. [024] It seemed as if, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired a new dignity of mind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of form and feature; and therewithal she was now grown so engaging and gracious and debonair, that she shewed no longer as the shepherdess, and the daughter of Giannucolo, but as the daughter of some noble lord, insomuch that she caused as many as had known her before to marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and devoted to her husband, that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest man in the world. [025] And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her husband's vassals, that there was none of them but loved her more dearly than himself, and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her welfare and prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile, saying that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment, for that, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained hidden under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl. [026] And in short she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it to pass that, not only in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her virtues and her admirable conversation were matter of common talk, and, if aught had been said to the disadvantage of her husband, when he married her, the judgment was now altogether to the contrary effect.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [027] She had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and in due time she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great cheer. But, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him, to wit, to put her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable hard usage; wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes, putting on a vexed air, and telling her that his vassals were most sorely dissatisfied with her by reason of her base condition, and all the more so since they saw that she was a mother, and that they did nought but most ruefully murmur at the birth of a daughter. [028] Whereto Griselda, without the least change of countenance or sign of discomposure, made answer: \"My lord, do with me as thou mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot that I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.\"[029] By which answer Gualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree puffed up with pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment of her. [030] A while afterwards, having in general terms given his wife to understand that the vassals could not endure her daughter, he sent her a message by a servant. So the servant came, and: \"Madam,\" quoth he with a most dolorous mien, \"so I value my life, I must needs do my lord's bidding. He has bidden me take your daughter and . . .\"[031] He said no more, but the lady by what she heard, and read in his face, and remembered of her husband's words, understood that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon she presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and blessed her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not countenance, but placed it in the servant's arms, saying: [032] \"See that thou leave nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he have so bidden thee.\"[033] So the servant took the child, and told Gualtieri what the lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her constancy, sent him with the child to Bologna, to one of his kinswomen, whom he besought to rear and educate the child with all care, but never to let it be known whose child she was.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [034] Soon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due time was delivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But, not content with what he had done, he now even more poignantly afflicted the lady; and one day with a ruffled mien: [035] \"Wife,\" quoth he, \"since thou gavest birth to this boy, I may on no wise live in peace with my vassals, so bitterly do they reproach me that a grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed me as their lord; and therefore I fear that, so I be not minded to be sent a packing hence, I must even do herein as I did before, and in the end put thee away, and take another wife.\"[036] The lady heard him patiently, and answered only: \"My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best please thyself, and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I desire save in so far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.\"[037] Not many days after, Gualtieri, in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent for the son, and having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for his, as for the girl's, nurture at Bologna. [038] Whereat the lady shewed no more discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her daughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed that there was never another woman in the world that would have so done. And but that he had marked that she was most tenderly affectionate towards her children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he had supposed that she was tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas of her discretion that she so did. [039] His vassals, who believed that he had put the children to death, held him mightily to blame for his cruelty, and felt the utmost compassion for the lady. She, however, said never aught to the ladies that condoled with her on the death of her children, but that the pleasure of him that had begotten them was her pleasure likewise.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [040] Years not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri at length deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the final proof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his vassals he declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have Griselda to wife, that he confessed that in taking her he had done a sorry thing and the act of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to do what he could to procure the Pope's dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another wife: for which cause being much upbraided by many worthy men, he made no other answer but only that needs must it so be. [041] Whereof the lady being apprised, and now deeming that she must look to go back to her father's house, and perchance tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him, to whom she was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly bewail herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with which she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure this last outrage. [042] Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit letters, which he caused to be sent to him from Rome, made his vassals believe that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused her to be brought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a few: [043] \"Wife, by license granted me by the Pope, I am now free to put thee away, and take another wife; and, for that my forbears have always been great gentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas thine have ever been husbandmen, I purpose that thou go back to Giannucolo's house with the dowry that thou broughtest me; whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I have found, and who is meet to be my wife.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [044] 'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she heard this announcement, got the better of her woman's nature, and suppressing her tears, made answer: \"My lord, I ever knew that my low degree was on no wise congruous with your nobility, and acknowledged that the rank I had with you was of your and God's bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it were mine by gift, or so esteem it, but still accounted it as a loan. 'Tis your pleasure to recall it, and therefore it should be, and is, my pleasure to render it up to you. So, here is your ring, with which you espoused me; take it back. [045] You bid me take with me the dowry that I brought you; which to do will require neither paymaster on your part nor purse nor packhorse on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when you first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I have borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I depart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity that I brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence upon my back a single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.\"[046] There was nought of which Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but yet, setting his face as a flint, he made answer: \"I allow thee a shift to thy back; so get thee hence.\"[047] All that stood by besought him to give her a robe, that she, who had been his wife for thirteen years and more, might not be seen to quit his house in so sorry and shameful a plight, having nought on her but a shift. But their entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and barefoot and bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and went back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw her. [048] Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible that Gualtieri should keep his daughter to wife, and had looked for this to happen every day, and had kept the clothes that she had put off on the morning that Gualtieri had wedded her, now brought them to her; and she, having resumed them, applied herself to the petty drudgery of her father's house, as she had been wont, enduring with fortitude this cruel visitation of adverse Fortune.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [049] Now no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed Griselda, than he gave his vassals to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of the Counts of Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as for the nuptials, during which he sent for Griselda. To whom, being come, quoth he: [050] \"I am bringing hither my new bride, and in this her first home-coming I purpose to shew her honour; and thou knowest that women I have none in the house that know how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other matters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that understandest these things better than another, see to all that needs be done, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and receive them, as if thou wert the lady of the house, and then, when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.\"[051] Albeit each of these words pierced Griselda's heart like a knife, for that, in resigning her good fortune, she had not been able to renounce the love she bore Gualtieri, nevertheless: \"My lord,\" she made answer, \"I am ready and prompt to do your pleasure.\"[052] And so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole, she entered the house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her shift, and addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and cushions in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to everything, as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the occasion demanded. [053] This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all the ladies of those parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the event. The day being come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in heart and soul and mien the lady, she received the ladies as they came, and gave each a gladsome greeting.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [054] Now Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at Bologna, which kinswoman was married into the family of the Counts of Panago; and, the girl being now twelve years old, and the loveliest creature that ever was seen, and the boy being about six years old, he had sent word to his kinswoman's husband at Bologna, praying him to be pleased to come with this girl and boy of his to Saluzzo, and to see that he brought a goodly and honourable company with him, and to give all to understand that he brought the girl to him to wife, and on no wis\xC3\xA8 to disclose to any, who she really was. [055] The gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of his setting forth arrived at Saluzzo about breakfast-time with the girl, and her brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of those parts, and much people besides, gathered there in expectation of Gualtieri's new bride. [056] Who, being received by the ladies, was no sooner come into the hall, where the tables were set, than Griselda advanced to meet her, saying with hearty cheer: \"Welcome, my lady.\" So the ladies, who had with much instance, but in vain, besought Gualtieri, either to let Griselda keep in another room, or at any rate to furnish her with one of the robes that had been hers, that she might not present herself in such a sorry guise before the strangers, sate down to table; and the service being begun, [057] the eyes of all were set on the girl, and every one said that Gualtieri had made a good exchange, and Griselda joined with the rest in greatly commending her, and also her little brother. [058] And now Gualtieri, sated at last with all that he had seen of his wife's patience, marking that this new and strange turn made not the least alteration in her demeanour, and being well assured that 'twas not due to apathy, for he knew her to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time to relieve her of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a resolute front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all, he said with a smile: \"And what thinkst thou of our bride?\"[059] \"My lord,\" replied Griselda, \"I think mighty well of her; and if she be but as discreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no doubt but you may reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable felicity; but with all earnestness I entreat you, that you spare her those tribulations which you did once inflict upon another that was yours, for I scarce think she would be able to bear them, as well because she is younger, as for that she has been delicately nurtured, whereas that other had known no respite of hardship since she was but a little child.\"[060] Marking that she made no doubt but that the girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit the less sweetly, Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him, and: [061] \"Griselda,\" said he, \"'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy long patience, and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and insensate, should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought, for that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou mightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how to take and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace with thee for the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when I came to take a wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to put the matter to the proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass and afflict thee. [062] And since I never knew thee either by deed or by word to deviate from my will, I now, deeming myself to have of thee that assurance of happiness which I desired, am minded to restore to thee at once all that, step by step, I took from thee, and by extremity of joy to compensate the tribulations that I inflicted on thee. [063] Receive, then, this girl, whom thou supposest to be my bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy children and mine. These are they, whom by thee and many another it has long been supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband, that loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is none that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [064] Which said, he embraced and kissed her; and then, while she wept for joy, they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter, all astonied to hear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly embraced, and explained to them, and many others that stood by, the whole mystery. [065] Whereat the ladies, transported with delight, rose from table and betook them with Griselda to a chamber, and, with better omen, divested her of her sorry garb, and arrayed her in one of her own robes of state; and so, in guise of a lady (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they led her back into the hall. [066] Wondrous was the cheer which there they made with the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and made merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days; and very discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected Griselda, and most discreet beyond all compare they accounted Griselda.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [067] Some days after, the Count of Panago returned to Bologna, and Gualtieri took Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him in honour as his father-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived for the rest of his days. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter with a husband of high degree, lived long and happily thereafter with Griselda, to whom he ever paid all honour.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [068] Now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of the poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces of kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over men? Who but Griselda had been able, with a countenance not only tearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which Gualtieri subjected her? [069] Who perhaps might have deemed himself to have made no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who, having been turned out of his house in her shift, had found means so to dust the pelisse of another as to get herself thereby a fine robe.\r\n\

    [Voice: filostrato]
    [003] Chidden have I been so often and by so many of you for the sore burden, which I laid upon you, of discourse harsh and meet for tears, that, as some compensation for such annoy, I deem myself bound to tell you somewhat that may cause you to laugh a little: wherefore my story, which will be of the briefest, shall be of a love, the course whereof, save for sighs and a brief passage of fear mingled with shame, ran smooth to a happy consummation.
    
    [Voice: filostrato]
    [004] Know then, noble ladies, that 'tis no long time since there dwelt in Romagna a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da Valbona by name, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it happened, there was born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina, [005] a daughter, who, as she grew up, became the fairest and most debonair of all the girls of those parts, and, for that she was the only daughter left to them, was most dearly loved and cherished by her father and mother, who guarded her with most jealous care, thinking to arrange some great match for her. [006] Now there was frequently in Messer Lizio's house, and much in his company, a fine, lusty young man, one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom Messer Lizio and his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as if he had been their own son: who, now and again taking note of the damsel, that she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour most commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with her, which love he was very careful to conceal. [007] The damsel detected it, however, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with him, to Ricciardo's no small satisfaction. [008] Again and again he was on the point of speaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length, however, he summoned up his courage, and seizing his opportunity, thus addressed her: "Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to die for love of thee."[009] Whereto the damsel forthwith responded: "Nay, God grant that it be not rather that I die for love of thee."[010] Greatly exhilarated and encouraged, Ricciardo made answer: "'Twill never be by default of mine that thou lackest aught that may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the means to save thy life and mine."[011] Then said the damsel: "Thou seest, Ricciardo, how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere possible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may do without dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it."[012] Ricciardo was silent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he said: "Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see, to wit, that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have access to the terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew that thou wouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive to meet thee, albeit 'tis very high."[013] "As for my sleeping there," replied Caterina, "I doubt not that it may be managed, if thou art sure that thou canst join me."[014] Ricciardo answered in the affirmative. Whereupon they exchanged a furtive kiss, and parted.
    
    [Voice: filostrato]
    [015] On the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the damsel began complaining to her mother that by reason of the excessive heat she had not been able to get any sleep during the night. [016] "Daughter," said the lady, "what heat was there? Nay, there was no heat at all."[017] "Had you said, 'to my thinking,' mother," rejoined Caterina, "you would perhaps have said sooth; but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have in them than ladies that are advanced in years."[018] "True, my daughter," returned the lady, "but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold, as thou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we find it, and as the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be cooler, and thou wilt sleep better."[019] "God grant it be so," said Caterina, "but 'tis not wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the summer comes on."[020] "What then," said the lady, "wouldst thou have me do?"[021] "With your leave and my father's," answered Caterina, "I should like to have a little bed made up on the terrace by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the nightingales sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much better than in your room."[022] Whereupon: "Daughter, be of good cheer," said the mother; "I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he shall decide."[023] So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between her and the damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason a little morose, said: "What nightingale is this, to whose chant she would fain sleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull her to sleep."[024] Which speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her such offence, that for anger, rather than by reason of the heat, she not only slept not herself that night, but suffered not her mother to sleep, keeping up a perpetual complaint of the great heat. [025] Wherefore her mother hied her in the morning to Messer Lizio, and said to him: "Sir, you hold your daughter none too dear; what difference can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She has tossed about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can you wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale sing? Young folk naturally affect their likes."[026] Whereto Messer Lizio made answer: "Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set a curtain round it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale sing to her heart's content."[027] Which the damsel no sooner learned, than she had a bed made there with intent to sleep there that same night; wherefore she watched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a concerted sign she gave to understand what he was to do. [028] Messer Lizio, as soon as he had heard the damsel go to bed, locked a door that led from his room to the terrace, and went to sleep himself. [029] When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of a ladder got upon a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain toothings of another wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had he fallen, clambered up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him quietly with the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then got them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and joyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few times. [030] But, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards dawn, albeit they wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm encircling Ricciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him by that part of his person which your modesty, my ladies, is most averse to name in the company of men. [031] So, peacefully they slept, and were still asleep when day broke and Messer Lizio rose; and calling to mind that his daughter slept on the terrace, softly opened the door, saying to himself: Let me see what sort of night's rest the nightingale has afforded our Caterina? [032] And having entered, he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and saw Ricciardo asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being quite naked and uncovered; [033] and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went away, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying: "Up, up, wife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale to such purpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand."[034] "How can this be?" said the lady. "[035] Come quickly, and thou shalt see," replied Messer Lizio. [036] So the lady huddled on her clothes, and silently followed Messer Lizio, and when they were come to the bed, and had raised the curtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly enough how her daughter had caught, and did hold the nightingale, whose song she had so longed to hear. [037] Whereat the lady, deeming that Ricciardo had played her a cruel trick, would have cried out and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to her: "Wife, as thou valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth, seeing that she has caught him, he shall be hers. [038] Ricciardo is a gentleman and wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our advantage: if he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry her, so that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage and not in that of another."[039] Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing that her husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had had a good night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale. So she kept silence; [040] nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo awoke; and, seeing that 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much as his life was worth, and aroused Caterina, saying: "Alas! my soul, what shall we do, now that day has come and surprised me here?"[041] Which question Messer Lizio answered by coming forward, and saying: "We shall do well."[042] At sight of him Ricciardo felt as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in the bed, and said: "My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that my disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with me even as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it may be, to spare my life, that I die not."[043] "Ricciardo," replied Messer Lizio, "the love I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited a better return; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into such a transgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by making Caterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for this past night, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way thou mayst secure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy soul to God."[044] Pending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale, and having covered herself, began with many a tear to implore her father to forgive Ricciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio required, that thereby they might securely count upon a long continuance of such nights of delight. [045] But there needed not much supplication; for, what with remorse for the wrong done, and the wish to make amends, and the fear of death, and the desire to escape it, and above all ardent love, and the craving to possess the beloved one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal of his readiness to do as Messer Lizio would have him. [046] Wherefore Messer Lizio, having borrowed a ring from Madonna Giacomina, Ricciardo did there and then in their presence wed Caterina. [047] Which done, Messer Lizio and the lady took their leave, saying: "Now rest ye a while; for so perchance 'twere better for you than if ye rose."[048] And so they left the young folks, who forthwith embraced, and not having travelled more than six miles during the night, went two miles further before they rose, and so concluded their first day. [049] When they were risen, Ricciardo and Messer Lizio discussed the matter with more formality; and some days afterwards Ricciardo, as was meet, married the damsel anew in presence of their friends and kinsfolk, and brought her home with great pomp, and celebrated his nuptials with due dignity and splendour. And so for many a year thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness, and snared the nightingales day and night to his heart's content.

    Sam was looking around the gas station for inspiration for a Christmas present for Dean when his eyes fell on the popcorn.
    
    He didn't eat popcorn often - he liked it fine, but it was the only kind of junk food he'd ever come across that Dean didn't like, so they tended to buy other things instead. The sight of it now brought back other memories, though: Jess smacking away his hand when he made a grab for the popcorn she was stringing together, helping her to hang the popcorn garlands on their Christmas tree. It was a tradition the Winchesters had missed entirely, growing up; their Christmas "celebrations" had always been somewhat makeshift.
    
    Sam had already decided that this year was going to be different. Last year, with the deal hanging over their heads, he'd had to force himself to go through with Christmas for Dean's sake. This year... this year, he really did feel like celebrating.
    
    He grabbed a packet of popcorn and headed to the desk. He'd have to think more about presents, but he still had time. Popcorn strings for the tree would be a good start.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Threading popcorn was an oddly peaceful pastime, Sam thought. It kept his hands busy, but left his mind free to wander. The associations with Jessica had lost their power to hurt him: now they just made him smile, before he thought about the expression on Dean's face the previous year when he'd walked in to see Sam's decorations. It had made all the trouble of organising it secretly and all the stress of trying to celebrate while knowing it might be Dean's last Christmas worthwhile. And Dean might be expecting eggnog this year, but a proper tree, with garlands? Sam was looking forward to springing that surprise on him.
    
    He was just tying a knot in the thread to hold the popcorn in place when he heard the sound of a key in the lock.
    
    <em>Damn</em>. What was Dean doing back so soon? Sam grabbed his half-finished string of popcorn, looked around frantically, and finally shoved it out of sight beneath the nearest pillow. The last thing he wanted was for his surprise to be ruined. Then he swung his legs up and lay back on the bed, trying to look casual.
    
    "Hey," Dean said, closing the door behind him and throwing the key down on the table. He set a paper bag down more gently and stripped off his coat. "So, the kid seems to be fine."
    
    "Good," Sam said. He'd been fairly sure she would be, now that she'd been reunited with her family, but he hadn't been surprised that Dean had wanted to check up on her. He felt a warm rush of affection for his brother. "You pick out a Christmas present for her?"
    
    "I had an idea, yeah," Dean said. "We can pick it up later on and take it round."
    
    "Okay," Sam agreed. "What's in the bag?"
    
    Dean grinned, slow and promising. "Pie."
    
    Sam knew his brother far too well to be surprised by the combination of <em>that</em> smile and food. If there were three things in the world that Dean loved, they were Sam, sex and food, and he took every opportunity he could to combine them. Sam figured it was only the mess caused by sex involving food that held Dean back from bringing the Impala into that equation more often. And even though Sam didn't share Dean's obsession with food, he was usually happy to indulge it. He wasn't immune to that smile.
    
    "What kind of pie?" Sam asked, trying to appear unaffected.
    
    The way Dean's grin widened told him he hadn't succeeded. "Lemon meringue." He grabbed the bag and crawled up onto the bed, close enough for Sam to feel how cold he still was from the chill air outside.
    
    He had a feeling that Dean would be heating up pretty soon, though.
    
    Eating slices of lemon meringue pie without a fork or even a plate was a pretty messy experience, but Sam figured Dean considered that part of the appeal. He certainly wasn't surprised when Dean leaned over after a couple of bites to lick away a smudge of cream from the corner of Sam's mouth, which turned into a teasing, flickering kiss, and then a deeper, more serious kiss, lemon flavour giving way to <em>Dean</em>.
    
    Sam was about ready to put his pie down and concentrate on more important matters, but Dean pressed his slice to Sam's lips instead. "Go on, Sammy."
    
    The only thing Sam didn't like about food sex was that he was never completely certain that it was him, rather than the food, that was putting that breathy, turned-on note into Dean's voice.
    
    <em>Better make sure, then</em>.
    
    He licked at the pie and moaned softly at the rich, bitter taste of lemon on his tongue, fighting back a grin at the way Dean's eyes darkened in response. Then he took a bite, letting his eyes fall closed as he savoured it, enjoying it even more when Dean's lips pressed to his, tongue slipping inside to steal a taste.
    
    "Sam," Dean murmured, pulling back, and then he was working on Sam's clothes, shoving his shirt aside to smear pie across his chest, licking it up with a moan.
    
    Things went rather hazy at that point. Sam suspected he'd just crushed half a slice of pie into the comforter, but he was too busy getting Dean out of his clothes to give a damn. And Dean finally seemed to be more interested in sex than pie, judging by the way he was moaning as Sam closed a hand around his cock. Sam couldn't help a small, triumphant smile at that.
    
    "Sam," Dean said, and writhed up as Sam shifted his grasp. "Oh, Jesus, Sam - fuck me, god."
    
    Sam kissed him instead of answering, pressing him down against the bed.
    
    "Sammy," Dean muttered breathlessly, sliding a hand beneath the pillows to find the lube. "Fuck -" He cut off suddenly, an odd expression crossing his face. "What...?"
    
    It was only when Dean pulled out the string of popcorn that Sam remembered he'd shoved it under there. <em>Damn, there's that surprise ruined</em>.
    
    Dean stared at it, frowning in confusion. "Dude, what...?" His voice trailed off as his eyes suddenly widened. "<em>Dude</em>."
    
    "I thought -" Sam started.
    
    "Dude," Dean repeated. He looked simultaneously horrified and morbidly curious, and just a little turned on. "You don't - you seriously want - I mean, you really want to...?"
    
    Sam wasn't entirely sure what conclusion Dean had jumped to, but he was pretty sure it didn't involve hanging the popcorn on the Christmas tree. "Uh, Dean -"
    
    "I mean," Dean said, and stopped again. "Wow, Sam, I didn't think you'd, uh. Be into - that."
    
    Sam eyed the popcorn with a certain morbid curiosity himself. Did he really want to know what Dean was thinking? His brother's mind could be a scary place at the best of times. On the other hand, the look on Dean's face was pretty hilarious. "Well, I thought it might be... nice."
    
    "Nice," Dean repeated dazedly.
    
    "Look, it's nothing," Sam said. "Just something Jess introduced me to - forget about it." He felt a little bad for playing Dean, but he justified it by reminding himself that he wasn't actually <em>lying</em>. Besides, he wanted to save his surprise if at all possible. So it was for Dean's own good. From a certain point of view.
    
    If anything, Dean's eyes got wider. "And you, uh, liked that?"
    
    Okay, Sam really had to find out what Dean was thinking now. "Sure. But we don't have to, you know."
    
    The thing was, Dean never backed down from any kind of challenge. Particularly when it came to sex. "No, we can - I mean, if you... I just never thought popcorn would be any good for - that. Doesn't it kind of - crumble?"
    
    "Not if you do it right," Sam said, and bit his tongue to keep from laughing.
    
    "Jesus," Dean muttered. "Okay, fine." He thrust the popcorn chain at Sam. "You'd better use lube before sticking that in me, though."
    
    It was just as well Dean's eyes were still glued to the popcorn, because Sam couldn't keep his own eyes from widening. Dean thought... Well, okay, Sam guessed popcorn was vaguely bead-shaped, and he knew that Dean mostly saw food and sex as one and the same thing, and admittedly Dean had found it under the pillow - but <em>seriously</em>?
    
    Oh, man, how was he going to get out of this one? Because Sam was pretty sure popcorn was <em>not</em> best suited to that kind of thing. And - just, no. Although it was kind of hot that Dean was willing to go along with it. Almost tempting.
    
    ...But no.
    
    "Well, it's not quite finished yet," Sam said, trying to keep his voice even. <em>Not going to laugh, not going to laugh</em>... "I need to add more popcorn -"
    
    "<em>More</em>?" Dean blurted.
    
    <em>Not going to laugh</em>. "Sure. And then it's best to let it harden for a day or so. I just shoved it out of sight when you came in, didn't want to ruin the surprise."
    
    "Oh," Dean said, trying not to look too obviously relieved and failing. "Well, if it's not finished -"
    
    "Popcorn doesn't go too well with lemon meringue pie, anyway," Sam said, and tossed the half-finished garland onto the nightstand, biting his cheek to keep from laughing at the way Dean's eyes tracked it. He ought to tell his brother, he really should. But Dean's reaction was far too amusing.
    
    "Right," Dean said, brightening. "Hey, you've got -" He swooped in to suck at a smudge of cream on Sam's neck.
    
    Sam grinned and set about distracting them both from the popcorn.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    "Thank you!" the little girl squealed, running into the kitchen with her present. "Mommy, Mommy, look!"
    
    Dean laughed, and Sam grinned at the happiness on his brother's face. He was glad they'd been able to reunite this family before Christmas.
    
    "I can't thank you both enough," the kid's father said, running a hand through his greying hair. "Won't you stay for coffee?"
    
    "Coffee sounds great," Dean said, following him towards the kitchen.
    
    "Thanks," Sam added. Normally he didn't like sticking around for too long, didn't want to impose on people, but he was willing to bet that if they hung around a little longer, the little girl would wheedle Dean into playing with her new My Little Pony with her, and that Sam had to see.
    
    Just inside the kitchen, though, Dean froze. Sam peered round him to see what the problem was.
    
    The little girl's mother was sitting at the kitchen table, a bowl of popcorn beside her, calmly threading the pieces together into a garland.
    
    Dean's eyes were huge as they slid from the string of popcorn to the couple and back again, before he turned his head to stare at Sam. Sam bit his lip and tried not to bust a rib laughing.
    
    "Uh, actually," Dean said, and cleared his throat. His voice sounded rather higher-pitched than usual. "You know, you're obviously... busy, and we don't want to, uh, intrude, so we should probably be going, right, Sam?"
    
    Sam <em>really</em> wanted to stick around now, because the look on Dean's face was priceless. But he wasn't going to be able to keep from laughing for much longer. "Yeah, you're right. Thanks for the offer, though - I hope you all have a very merry Christmas."
    
    "Yeah, very merry," Dean echoed, staring at the popcorn.
    
    The couple tried to talk them into staying for coffee, but they managed to escape before Dean blurted out any comments on the couple's sex life or Sam actually suffocated from trying not to laugh at Dean's expression.
    
    "<em>Dude</em>," Dean hissed as they walked down the driveway. "Did you <em>see</em> what she was making?!"
    
    Sam had never heard Dean sound scandalised before. It was <em>awesome</em>.
    
    "Yeah," Sam said, trying desperately to keep a straight face.
    
    He couldn't wait to see the expression on Dean's face when he saw the decorated Christmas tree waiting back at the motel.

    The door is very loud as it closes behind him, and Dean shrinks further into himself, away from her reaching hand.
    
    "It's okay, Dean." Her voice sounds sweet but firm, and Dean knows what she really means is <em>You have to stay and do what I tell you</em>. "Your daddy and your baby brother are just going to wait right outside while we talk again. Why don't you go sit down in your seat?"
    
    Dean doesn't look up at her, is careful to keep his eyes on the floor all the way to the little plastic chair next to the table. The chair is yellow. The table is red. Dean thinks he'd probably hate them, if he had any hate left over.
    
    She sits down on the floor on the other side of the little table, and Dean shifts his gaze to the table top. There's paper laid out on it, and crayons.
    
    He really, really wishes Daddy hadn't made him come back here again.
    
    "Now then," she says, "why don't we start by drawing something that's happened this week? Can you do that, Dean? Draw me something you've done, or something you've seen, or something you've thought about since the last time we saw each other. Okay?"
    
    Dean stares at the pieces of paper and doesn't move.
    
    "I'll go first, then," she says, and picks up one of the crayons. "Yesterday..." She sketches quickly as she speaks, drawing the words out. "I spoke to my father." Green and red and yellow. Dean doesn't look.
    
    "Now then, your turn," she says. Dean feels her eyes on him and lowers his head further.
    
    <em>She wants to help you</em>, Daddy had said. <em>Be good, Dean. Do what she tells you</em>.
    
    He doesn't want to draw, doesn't want to show her any part of him. But he picks up one of the crayons and draws a piece of paper towards him. It takes him a moment to decide what his picture should be, because he's not going to draw Sammy or Daddy, not for her. Finally he draws a cake, quick and messy.
    
    "Ah, yes, it was your birthday this week, wasn't it, Dean?" He can hear the smile in her voice. "Did you have candles on your cake?"
    
    There had been candles. Mrs Jones had baked him a birthday cake and put candles on it, and he'd stared at them when she lit them, tiny golden flames. He hadn't eaten any of his cake.
    
    "Okay, good," she says. "I'd like you to draw me a picture of the fire, now. The fire from that night."
    
    Dean puts his crayon down.
    
    "Dean," she says. Her voice is firm again. "You can either tell me about what you saw that night, or you can draw it. It's up to you."
    
    He stares at the table and shivers. He can't tell her, doesn't know where the words have gone, and wouldn't give them to her even if he did. He doesn't want to draw this for her either.
    
    <em>Be good, Dean.</em>
    
    Slowly he picks up the yellow crayon, and hears her draw in breath.
    
    The flames he draws are sharp and jagged, yellow then orange then red, filling the page. He focuses on the crayons and tries not to look.
    
    "That's good," she says. "But it's not all. You saw something else that night, didn't you? Draw it for me, Dean."
    
    He saw a lot of things that night, things he doesn't like remembering - saw his home vanish, saw his Daddy cry. Saw...
    
    "Draw it for me," she insists.
    
    Dean swallows, and picks up the yellow crayon again. Fiddles with the edge of a flame, biting his lip.
    
    "I see lots of cases like yours," she tells him, her voice lower. "Families ripped apart by fires. But none of them had - you're unique, Dean, do you know what that means?"
    
    <em>You're special</em>, Mommy used to say. <em>You're special, Dean. So you've got to be careful.</em>
    
    "Special is one word for it." He knows if he looks up she'll be smiling again. "You're different. You break all the patterns. And I want to know why."
    
    He looks up at her.
    
    The table almost topples over as he scrambles to his feet, and then he's running for the door, reaching up for the handle. He can hear his own breathing, frantic little gasps as he struggles with the door, and then it's open and he's out and he doesn't stop running until he collides with Daddy's legs.
    
    "Whoa, easy, Dean," Daddy says, his hand coming down to touch Dean's head. He stands up, and Dean immediately slips behind him, hiding as best he can, because he can hear the <em>tap tap</em> of her footsteps coming closer.
    
    "Is he -?"
    
    "It's really a good sign," she says. "Children react to grief in all sorts of ways, and if he's starting to express that rather than locking it inside himself, that's real progress."
    
    Dean clings on to Daddy's legs, and wisheswisheswishes Mommy was here.
    
    "I'd like to see Dean again in a week," she tells Daddy. "Please make an appointment with my assistant on your way out."
    
    "Okay," Daddy says. "Thank you for your time. C'mon, Dean, time to go."
    
    Dean lets Daddy take his hand and draw him out of the room, then Daddy sets Sammy's carrier down, and Dean stays close to it while Daddy goes across to talk to the man at the desk.
    
    <em>So you've got to be careful. And if you see anyone with black eyes, you run, Dean. You run and you find me and you tell me right away, do you understand?</em>
    
    "All set," Daddy says, picking Sammy's carrier up again. "Let's go."
    
    Dean follows silently, because he doesn't know what else to do. He can't run and tell Mommy, not any more.
    
    He <em>really</em> wishes Mommy was here.

    it looks like adding an author to the first chapter automatically adds it to the whole work, testing to see if this happens for the other chapters or not

    THE CLERK'S TALE\r\n\
    Part I\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ther is, right at the west syde of ytaille,\r\n\
    Doun at the roote of vesulus the colde,\r\n\
    A lusty playn, habundant of vitaille,\r\n\
    Where many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,\r\n\
    That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,\r\n\
    And many another delitable sighte,\r\n\
    And saluces this noble contree highte.\r\n\
    A markys whilom lord was of that lond,\r\n\
    As were his worthy eldres hym bifore;\r\n\
    And obeisant, ay redy to his hond,\r\n\
    Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and moore.\r\n\
    Thus in delit he lyveth, and hath doon yoore,\r\n\
    Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of fortune,\r\n\
    Bothe of his lordes and of his commune.\r\n\
    Therwith he was, to speke as of lynage,\r\n\
    The gentillest yborn of lumbardye,\r\n\
    A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,\r\n\
    And ful of honour and of curteisye;\r\n\
    Discreet ynogh his contree for to gye,\r\n\
    Save in somme thynges that he was to blame;\r\n\
    And walter was this yonge lordes name.\r\n\
    I blame hym thus, that he considered noght\r\n\
    In tyme comynge what myghte hym bityde,\r\n\
    But on his lust present was al his thoght,\r\n\
    As for to hauke and hunte on every syde.\r\n\

    It's hard enough to get Dean onto the plane for a half-hour flight, so Sam is profoundly grateful that his brother is too busy pretending not to panic and humming Metallica to notice that the flight they've checked into is to London, England, not London, Ohio.
    
    When the pilot makes his announcements and Dean <em>does</em> realise just how long he's going to be on the plane, Sam only just escapes receiving an injury to a part of his anatomy they'd both <em>really</em> rather stayed in working order. He waves the tickets under Dean's nose desperately.
    
    '...the hell you think you're - Led Zeppelin...?' Dean's brought up short from his rant.
    
    'Exclusive, one-off reunion concert,' Sam says smugly. 'Chance of a lifetime.'
    
    Dean opens and closes his mouth a few times, helplessly.
    
    'I'll still have to kill you for this,' he says finally. His hand settles heavy and warm on Sam's thigh. 'After the show.'
    
    Sam just keeps grinning.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean doesn't stop grinning the whole way through the show, even when an extremely fat and sweaty guy presses up against him and spills beer down his leather jacket. He's still flying high when the last song's been played and the crowd is spilling out on the street.
    
    'When they played <em>Nobody's Fault</em>, oh dude. I can die happy, now.' Dean's happy glow diminishes for a second when he realises what he's said, because they've had a moratorium on those kind of comments for a while now.
    
    Sam doesn't stop smiling. 'Yeah, about that. You might want to hold off for a while.'
    
    Dean stares at him. 'Sam, if I try to break the deal -'
    
    'If <em>you</em> try to break the deal, yeah.' Sam pulls out a little wooden carving, recognisably Dean except for how it has a big shiny patch smack bang in the middle of its chest. 'You really think I'd bring you all the way to England just to see a bunch of granddads? That guy who spilled his drink on you is the foremost expert in soul magic in the Western hemisphere. He just had to baptise you in the flesh to make the spell stick.'
    
    'Then this...' Dean gestures at the Dean doll. 'You got my soul back?'
    
    Sam just smiles, the kind of smile that says if he tries to say anything he'll end up crying like a girl.
    
    '<em>Dude</em>.'
    
    And maybe Sam could have gone with the crying thing after all, because Dean kisses him right there in the street, big Hollywood smacker, and maybe that even tops seeing Led Zeppelin play live.

  content: "The first time, Bellatrix doesn't even know the girl's name.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix is striding through the dark lower levels of the Dark Lord\xE2\x80\x99s headquarters when the young woman rounds a corner and stops just short of running into her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She\xE2\x80\x99s perhaps seventeen or so, and almost pretty, Bellatrix observes in the first awkward moment. Not in the way that Bellatrix was at that age, before Azkaban clawed its marks into her face, but in the demure manner of a prim, well brought-up pure-blood girl \xE2\x80\x93 black hair confined in a severe bob, delicate cheekbones, a faint flush to her pale face, and dark eyes now lit up with something like awe as she drinks in Bellatrix\xE2\x80\x99s appearance. Bellatrix is mildly surprised that this child shows no obvious distaste for the scars and lines which mar her face, nor any of the revulsion and fear that she so often inspires.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CMy Lady Bellatrix,\xE2\x80\x9D the girl murmurs reverently, and curtsies deeply. The gesture of respect is hauntingly familiar to Bellatrix from all the childhood hours she spent practising it herself, at her parents\xE2\x80\x99 insistence. Foolishness, of course; these days she curtsies to no one, and looks on those who do with scorn. She smiles mockingly at the girl. <i>A pretty little pure-blooded Hufflepuff, no doubt. Little fool</i>...\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The girl straightens again, raising her eyes to gaze at Bellatrix once more. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m honoured to meet you, my lady. I\xE2\x80\x99ve heard of you all my life...\xE2\x80\x9D Her face is still filled with awe and respect. And something else, which Bellatrix takes several moments to identify. It\xE2\x80\x99s deeply buried and no doubt subconscious, but Bellatrix is almost certain it\xE2\x80\x99s desire.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix feels her smile widen slightly. <i>Well, well</i>. She reaches a decision. Thirteen years in Azkaban have left her inclined to indulge her whims. And almost-pretty little Hufflepuffs should not be wandering around in the depths of the Dark Lord\xE2\x80\x99s headquarters by themselves. Really, it\xE2\x80\x99s her duty to teach the girl a lesson or two. Using a young fool with a bad case of hero-worship is not the kind of thing which will trouble her conscience, although admittedly, little does these days.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So she reaches out and touches the girl\xE2\x80\x99s fine-boned face, watching with detached, cynical satisfaction as the girl\xE2\x80\x99s eyes widen and then fall shut, and smiling as her breathing hitches. Bellatrix allows her hand to slide lower, tracing the delicate line of the girl\xE2\x80\x99s jaw and the arch of her neck, until it reaches her shoulder.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Then she shoves the young woman abruptly to her knees, hard enough to bruise them on the stone floor. The girl\xE2\x80\x99s dark eyes fly open, and Bellatrix smiles at her cruelly. \xE2\x80\x9CA pretty little Hufflepuff who curtsies so deeply should be perfectly comfortable kneeling, surely?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For a moment, Bellatrix thinks the girl is about to protest, and really, she is hardly in the mood to listen to the pathetic whimpering of a young fool who deserves whatever she gets. So she doesn\xE2\x80\x99t give her a chance to speak, instead reaching out to tangle her fingers in the girl\xE2\x80\x99s black hair and then tugging cruelly, and is rewarded by a faint gasp of pain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The little Hufflepuff\xE2\x80\x99s eyes are now filled with so many emotions that Bellatrix is unable to read them all; she can see pain and shock, and something which looks like fear, but also the same flickering of almost-suppressed desire she\xE2\x80\x99d seen before.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For a split-second, Bellatrix considers her options. She could use the Imperius curse, but really, with a Hufflepuff, Imperius hardly seems necessary.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So Bellatrix simply pulls the skirts of her robes up and out of the way with her free hand, watching with amusement as the girl\xE2\x80\x99s eyes widen again in dawning realisation. But before the girl can try to fight her way free, Bellatrix yanks on her hair and drags her mouth to where she wants it to be. It is only much, much later that Bellatrix realises the girl did not actually try to resist at all, and in retrospect she thinks that that should have been her first clue.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The girl\xE2\x80\x99s mouth is hesitant and uncertain as it moves against her, and Bellatrix smiles and yanks sharply on black hair to guide her. She relishes the control, the girl\xE2\x80\x99s helpless obedience, feeling the pleasure slowly building in her as the little Hufflepuff moves her mouth in response to Bellatrix\xE2\x80\x99s silent directions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Then suddenly Bellatrix\xE2\x80\x99s breath catches as the girl does something with her tongue that Bellatrix most certainly did <i>not</i> direct her to do. Bellatrix pulls the girl\xE2\x80\x99s hair savagely \xE2\x80\x93 <i>obey me!</i> \xE2\x80\x93 but the girl pays no heed to the unspoken command, her mouth now ruthless and the sensation shockingly unexpected. Bellatrix yanks harder on the girl\xE2\x80\x99s hair and curses, feeling heat suddenly flooding through her. Her precious control is <i>gone</i>, and she is shuddering, coming, before she fully understands what is happening.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix grabs the girl by the shoulders and shoves her away as the pressure of her mouth becomes unbearable. She doesn\xE2\x80\x99t release her grip immediately, since her legs are suddenly decidedly unsteady, but instead rests her hands there and tries to calm her breathing.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The girl is looking up at her with a demure half-smile on her lips, and the temerity of her composure almost leaves Bellatrix breathless. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m actually a Slytherin, my Lady Bellatrix. For future reference.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix stares at her. The girl\xE2\x80\x99s dark eyes are alight with amusement and satisfaction, and she is no longer bothering to mask the desire she had half-hidden before. Her black hair is now a tangled mess and standing up in all directions, and her pale face is damp. As Bellatrix releases her completely, the girl reaches calmly into a pocket and pulls out a handkerchief, dabbing delicately at her face.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CIndeed,\xE2\x80\x9D Bellatrix finally replies non-committally, straightening her robes, wondering who has really been using whom. Without another word, she turns and strides off along the corridor again, leaving the girl still kneeling on the stone floor.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <i>That\xE2\x80\x99s one to keep my eye on</i>."
